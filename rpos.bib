We examined the transcription of Pseudomonas aeruginosa rpoS as to the growth of cells. The results of quantitative S1 nuclease mapping of rpoS and rpoD, encoding the principal sigma factor, indicated that the transcription of rpoS is induced in stationary-phase cells, whereas that of rpoD is induced in exponential-phase cells. By high-resolution S1 nuclease mapping, the 5'- and 3'-ends of rpoS mRNA were determined. The results indicated that rpoS is transcribed as a monocistronic mRNA. The sequence preceding the 5' end of rpoS mRNA showed poor homology to the consensus sequences of the previously known promoters. P. aeruginosa rpoS was not transcribed in E. coli. By in vitro transcription assaying, P. aeruginosa rpoS was shown to be transcribed by the RNA polymerase fraction containing the principal sigma (sigma 70)-RNA polymerase of P. aeruginosa.},

Transformation efficiency declines linearly with increasing plasmid size. Relaxed and supercoiled plasmids transform with similar probabilities. Non-transforming DNAs compete consistent with mass. No significant variation is observed between competing DNAs of different source, complexity, length or form. Competition with both transforming and non-transforming plasmids indicates that each cell is capable of taking up many DNA molecules, and that the establishment of a transformation event is neither helped nor hindered significantly by the presence of multiple plasmids.},

Plasmids in mice that express hybrid insulin transgenes during development can be readily cloned into E. coli strains carrying mutations in two of the MDRS loci, mcrA and mcrB. In mice in which transgene expression is inappropriately delayed into adulthood, plasmids can only be cloned into E. coli that carry mutations in all known MDRS activities. Differential cloning frequencies in the presence or absence of the various methylation-dependent restriction genes represent a further way to distinguish regions of mammalian chromosomes.

The location of the transposon insertions in the two genes was determined by Southern blotting of genomic digests to further confirm the identity of the cloned genes.

This assay is based upon the differential heat stabilities of the two enzymes and offers significant advantages over previous methods for quantitation of their activities. Measurement of catalase activities in extracts of various mutant strains confirmed the ability of this method to accurately distinguish the two activities. Contrary to previously published results, HPI catalase activity was observed to increase at stationary phase in strains lacking the stationary-phase sigma factor sigma(s) (RpoS). This increase was independent of OxyR and also occurred in a strain lacking the HPII structural gene, katE. These results suggest a potential novel pathway for HPI induction in response to increased oxidative stress in the absence of HPII. Measurement of HPII activity in strains carrying mutations in pcm (encoding the L-isoaspartyl protein methyltransferase) and surE led to the finding that these strains also have an amber mutation in rpoS; sequencing demonstrated the presence of this mutation in several commonly used laboratory strains of E. coli, including AB1157, W1485, and JC7623.},

   Abstract = {Obligate parasitic bacteria of the genus Chlamydia possess a developmental cycle that takes place entirely within eucaryotic host cells. Because standard methods of genetic analysis are not available for chlamydiae, an in vitro transcription system has been developed to elucidate the mechanisms by which chlamydiae regulate gene expression. The in vitro system is specific for chlamydial promoters but is inefficient, presumably because the RNA polymerase is not saturated with sigma factor. Therefore, we prepared recombinant Chlamydia psittaci 6BC major sigma factor to enhance transcription in the in vitro system. The gene encoding the major sigma factor (sigA) was identified by using an rpoD box oligonucleotide and was subsequently cloned and sequenced. It was found to encode a potential 571-amino-acid protein (sigma 66) that is greater than 90% identical to the previously identified major sigma factors from the L2 and MoPn strains of Chlamydia trachomatis. sigA was recloned into a T7 RNA polymerase expression system to produce large quantities of sigma 66 in Escherichia coli. Overexpressed sigma 66 was identified by immunoblot by using monoclonal antibodies 2G10 (reactive) and 2F8 (nonreactive) generated against E. coli sigma 70. After purification by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the recombinant protein was found to stimulate, by 10-fold or more, promoter-specific in vitro transcription by C. psittaci 6BC and C. trachomatis L2 RNA polymerases. Transcription was dependent on added chlamydial sigma 66, rather than on potentially contaminating E. coli sigma 70 or other fortuitous activators, since the monoclonal antibody 2G10, and not 2F8, inhibited transcription initiation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Southern blot surveys with a sigF-specific probe identified cross-hybridizing bands in other slow-growing mycobacteria, Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and Mycobacterium avium, but not in the rapid-growers Mycobacterium smegmatis or Mycobacterium abscessus. RNase protection assays revealed that M. tuberculosis sigF mRNA is not present during exponential-phase growth in M. bovis BCG cultures but is strongly induced during stationary phase, nitrogen depletion, and cold shock. Weak expression of M. tuberculosis sigF was also detected during late-exponential phase, oxidative stress, anaerobiasis, and alcohol shock. The specific expression of M. tuberculosis sigF during stress or stationary phase suggests that it may play a role in the ability of tubercle bacilli to adapt to host defenses and persist during human infection.},

The rpoS gene of P. putida complemented the acid sensitivity and catalase deficiency of the rpoS mutant of E. coli and stimulated expression of the RpoS-controlled promoter, bolAp1. The gene was sequenced and found to be highly similar to the rpoS genes of other gram-negative bacteria. Like in other gram-negative bacteria, a homolog of the nlpD gene was found upstream to the rpoS gene. A transcriptional fusion of the promoter of the P. putida rpoS gene to the luxAB genes from Vibrio harveyi was constructed and used as an inactivated allele of rpoS for gene replacement of the wild-type copy in the chromosome of P. putida. The resultant rpoS mutant of P.putida, C1R1, showed reduced survival of carbon starvation and reduced cross-protection against other types of stress in cells starved for carbon, in particular after a challenge with ethanol. Survival in soil amended with m-methylbenzoate was also reduced in the mutant strain P. putida C1R1. The RpoS protein of P. putida controls the expression of more than 50 peptides, which are normally expressed in cells after a short period of carbon starvation.},

   Abstract = {Many of the changes in gene expression observed when Escherichia coli cells enter stationary phase are regulated at the level of transcription initiation. A group of stationary-phase-inducible promoters, known as "gearbox" promoter, display a characteristic sequence in the -10 region which differs greatly from the consensus sequence for sigma 70-dependent promoters. Here we describe our studies on the gearbox promoters bolAp1 and mcbAp, responsible for the temporally regulated transcription of bolA and the genes involved in the synthesis of the peptide antibiotic microcin B17, respectively. Deletion analysis of mcbAp demonstrated that the stationary-phase-inducible properties of this promoter are found in a DNA fragment extending from -54 to +11 bp, surrounding the transcriptional start site, and are separable from DNA sequences responsible for the OmpR-dependent stimulation of transcription of mcbAp. In vitro transcription studies indicate that the RNA polymerase holoenzyme involved in the transcription of mcbAp contains sigma 70. In this and an accompanying paper (R. Lange and R. Hengge-Aronis, J. Bacteriol. 173: 4474-4481, 1991), experiments are described which show that the product of katF, a global regulator of stationary-phase gene expression and a putative sigma factor, is required for the expression of bolAp1 fused to the reporter gene lacZ. In contrast, mcbAp appears to be negatively regulated by katF. We discuss the implications of these results for postexponential gene expression and the role of gearbox sequences in the regulation of promoter activity.},

The effects of these three genes on the in planta bacterial growth of race 4 transconjugants have also been examined.

Here we demonstrate that the histone-like protein H-NS is also a component of this network, in which it functions as a global inhibitor of gene expression during the exponential phase of growth. On two-dimensional gels, at least 22 sigma S-controlled proteins show increased expression in an hns mutant. H-NS also inhibits the expression of sigma S itself by a mechanism that acts at the posttranscriptional level. Our results indicate that relief of repression by H-NS plays a role in stationary-phase induction as well as in hyperosmotic induction of rpoS translation. Whereas certain sigma S-dependent genes (e.g., osmY) are only indirectly regulated by H-NS via its role in the control of sigma S expression, others are also H-NS-regulated in a sigma S-independent manner. (For this latter class of genes, rpoS hns double mutants show higher levels of expression than mutants deficient in rpoS alone.) In addition, we demonstrate that the slow-growth phenotype of hns mutants is suppressed in hns rpoS double mutants and that many second-site suppressor mutants that spontaneously arise from hns strains carry lesions that affect the expression of sigma S.},

Also, rpoS-dependent thermotolerance and resistance against hydrogen peroxide could be osmotically stimulated. In contrast, the expression of glgS, while exhibiting strong stationary-phase induction, was only weakly increased by elevated osmolarity, and several rpoS-dependent proteins previously identified on two-dimensional gels were not osmotically induced. During osmotic induction of rpoS-dependent genes, rpoS transcription and the level of sigma S remained unchanged. We conclude that osmotically regulated genes represent a subfamily within the rpoS regulon that requires differential regulation in addition to that provided by sigma S.},

Conserved domain 1.1 at the N-terminal end of sigma(70) has been shown to be essential for RNA polymerase function, and its deletion has been shown to result in a dominant-lethal phenotype. We now report that a sigma(S) variant with a deletion of its N-terminal 50 amino acids (sigma(S)Delta1-50), when expressed in vivo either from a chromosomal rpoS::IS10 allele (in rho mutant strains) or from a plasmid-borne arabinose-inducible promoter, is as proficient as the wild type in directing transcription from the proU P1 promoter; at three other sigma(S)-dependent promoters that were tested (osmY, katE, and csiD), the truncated protein exhibited a three- to sevenfold reduced range of activities. Catabolite repression at the csiD promoter (which requires both sigma(S) and cyclic AMP [cAMP]-cAMP receptor protein for its activity) was also preserved in the strain expressing sigma(S)Delta1-50. The intracellular content of sigma(S)Delta1-50 was regulated by culture variables such as growth phase, osmolarity, and temperature in the same manner as that described earlier for sigma(S), even when the truncated protein was expressed from a template that possessed neither the transcriptional nor the translational control elements of wild-type rpoS. Our results indicate that, unlike that in sigma(70), the N-terminal domain in sigma(S) may not be essential for the protein to function as a sigma factor in vivo. Furthermore, our results suggest that the induction of sigma(S)-specific promoters in stationary phase and during growth under conditions of high osmolarity or low temperature is mediated primarily through the regulation of sigma(S) protein degradation.},

Chi and D. H. Bartlett, J. Bacteriol. 175:7533-7540, 1993), and exconjugants were screened for the ability to grow at 280-atm hydrostatic pressure. Several clones were identified that had restored high-pressure growth. The complementing DNA was localized and in all cases found to possess strong homology to recD, a DNA recombination and repair gene. EC1002 was found to be deficient in plasmid stability, a phenotype also seen in Escherichia coli recD mutants. The defect in EC1002 was localized to a point mutation that created a stop codon within the recD gene. Two additional recD mutants were constructed by gene disruption and were both found to possess a pressure-sensitive growth phenotype, although the magnitude of the defect depended on the extent of 3' truncation of the recD coding sequence. Surprisingly, the introduction of the SS9 recD gene into an E. coli recD mutant had two dramatic effects. At high pressure, SS9 recD enabled growth in the E. coli mutant strain under conditions of plasmid antibiotic resistance selection and prevented cell filamentation. Both of these effects were recessive to wild-type E. coli recD. These results suggest that the SS9 recD gene plays an essential role in SS9 growth at high pressure and that it may be possible to identify additional aspects of RecD function through the characterization of this activity.},

In wild-type CHA0, 2, 4-DAPG production paralleled expression of a phlA'-'lacZ translational fusion, reaching a maximum in the late exponential growth phase. Thereafter, the compound appeared to be degraded to monoacetylphloroglucinol by the bacterium. 2,4-DAPG was identified as the active compound in extracts from culture supernatants of strain CHA0 specifically inducing phlA'-'lacZ expression about sixfold during exponential growth. Induction by exogenous 2,4-DAPG was most conspicuous in a phlA mutant, which was unable to produce 2, 4-DAPG. In a phlF mutant, 2,4-DAPG production was enhanced severalfold and phlA'-'lacZ was expressed at a level corresponding to that in the wild type with 2,4-DAPG added. The phlF mutant was insensitive to 2,4-DAPG addition. A transcriptional phlA-lacZ fusion was used to demonstrate that the repressor PhlF acts at the level of transcription. Expression of phlA'-'lacZ and 2,4-DAPG synthesis in strain CHA0 was strongly repressed by the bacterial extracellular metabolites salicylate and pyoluteorin as well as by fusaric acid, a toxin produced by the pythopathogenic fungus Fusarium. In the phlF mutant, these compounds did not affect phlA'-'lacZ expression and 2, 4-DAPG production. PhlF-mediated induction by 2,4-DAPG and repression by salicylate of phlA'-'lacZ expression was confirmed by using Escherichia coli as a heterologous host. In conclusion, our results show that autoinduction of 2,4-DAPG biosynthesis can be countered by certain bacterial (and fungal) metabolites. This mechanism, which depends on phlF function, may help P. fluorescens to produce homeostatically balanced amounts of extracellular metabolites.},

   Abstract = {The main sigma factor activating gene expression, necessary in stationary phase and under stress conditions, is sigma(S). In contrast to other minor sigma factors, RNA polymerase holoenzyme containing sigma(S) (Esigma(S)) recognizes a number of promoters which are also recognized by that containing sigma(70) (Esigma(70)). We have previously shown that transposon Tn4652 can activate silent genes in starving Pseudomonas putida cells by creating fusion promoters during transposition. The sequence of the fusion promoters is similar to the sigma(70)-specific promoter consensus. The -10 hexameric sequence and the sequence downstream from the -10 element differ among these promoters. We found that transcription from the fusion promoters is stationary phase specific. Based on in vivo experiments carried out with wild-type and rpoS-deficient mutant P. putida, the effect of sigma(S) on transcription from the fusion promoters was established only in some of these promoters. The importance of the sequence of the -10 hexamer has been pointed out in several published papers, but there is no information about whether the sequences downstream from the -10 element can affect sigma(S)-dependent transcription. Combination of the -10 hexameric sequences and downstream sequences of different fusion promoters revealed that sigma(S)-specific transcription from these promoters is not determined by the -10 hexameric sequence only. The results obtained in this study indicate that the sequence of the -10 element influences sigma(S)-specific transcription in concert with the sequence downstream from the -10 box.},

   Abstract = {The unique properties of nylon membranes allow for dramatic improvement in the capillary transfer of DNA restriction fragments from agarose gels (Southern blotting). By using 0.4 M NaOH as the transfer solvent following a short pre-treatment of the gel in acid, DNA is depurinated during transfer. Fragments of all sizes are eluted and retained quantitatively by the membrane; furthermore, the alkaline solvent induces covalent fixation of DNA to the membrane. The saving in time and materials afforded by this simple modification is accompanied by a marked improvement in resolution and a ten-fold increase in sensitivity of subsequent hybridization analyses. In addition, we have found that nylon membrane completely retains native (and denatured) DNA in transfer solvents of low ionic strength (including distilled water), although quantitative elution of DNA from the gel is limited to fragments smaller than 4 Kb. This property can be utilized in the direct electrophoretic transfer of native restriction fragments from polyacrylamide gels. Exposure of DNA to ultraviolet light, either in the gel or following transfer to nylon membrane, reduces its ability to hybridize.},

Heterogeneity was discovered with respect to two sigma subunits, sigma28 (sigmaF, the rpoF gene product) and sigma38 (sigmaS, the rpoS gene product). Five different types of W3110 were identified: A-type lineages have both sigma subunits in intact forms; B-type lineages carry a truncated sigma38 subunit and an intact sigma28 subunit; C-type lineages carry an intact sigma28 subunit but lack a sigma38 subunit; D-type lineages have only a sigma38 subunit without a sigma28 subunit; and E-type stocks lack both sigma subunits. All the lineages examined, however, contain the intact forms of sigma70 (sigmaD, the rpoD gene product) and sigma54 (sigmaN, the rpoN gene product). As expected from the lack of a sigma28 subunit, cells of D- and E-type lineages are nonmotile. The truncated form of the sigma38 subunit in B-type stocks carries two mutations near its N terminus and lacks C-terminal proximal region 4 due to an amber mutation. The failure of C- and E-type W3110 cells to express sigma38 and that of D- and E-type cells to express sigma28 were found to be due to defects in transcription even though the respective sigma subunit genes remain intact. These findings emphasize the importance of paying attention to possible variations in the genetic background between laboratory stocks originating from the same strain.},

The intervening region between mutS and rpoS was amplified by long-range PCR, and the resulting amplicons varied substantially in length (7.8 to 14.2 kb) among pathogenic groups. Restriction maps based on five enzymes and sequence analysis showed that strains of the EPEC 1, EPEC 2, and EHEC 2 groups have a long mutS-rpoS region composed of a ~6.0-kb DNA segment found in strain K-12 and a novel DNA segment (~2.9 kb) located at the 3' end of rpoS. The novel segment contains three genes (yclC, pad1, and slyA) that occur in E. coli O157:H7 and related strains but are not found in K-12 or members of the ECOR group A. Phylogenetic analysis of the common sequences indicates that the long intergenic region is ancestral and at least two separate deletion events gave rise to the shorter regions characteristic of the E. coli O157:H7 and K-12 lineages.},

The six non-K12 strains examined here had GAG, encoding glutamate, in position 33. The two most divergent strains had three and seven neutral substitutions in rpoS and carried insertions of 2100 and 2900 bp, respectively, just downstream of the gene. The genetic variations in rpoS were compared with the variation in RpoS-related phenotypes, by measuring catalase (KatE) activity, glycogen accumulation and acid phosphatase levels, and a katEp-gfp fusion was used to visualise katE gene transcription. The RpoS phenotypes of the six rpoS(33E) strains varied significantly more than that of the K12 rpoS(33Q) strains, especially with respect to acid phosphatase levels. This was due to the absence of the gene for the transcriptional activator AppY from four of the rpoS(33E) strains, while all the K12 derivatives carried this gene. When cloned into a LacI-controlled vector and compared in a rpoS::Tn 10 background, the RpoS(33Q) and RpoS(33E) variants showed the same activity.},

   Abstract = {When grown at high osmotic pressure, some strains of Escherichia coli K-12 synthesized substantial levels of free sugar and accumulated proline if it was present in the growth medium. The sugar was identified as trehalose by chemical reactivity, gas-liquid chromatography, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Strains of E. coli K-12 could be divided into two major classes with respect to osmoregulation. Those of class A showed a large increase in trehalose levels with increasing medium osmolarity and also accumulated proline from the medium, whereas those in class B showed no accumulation of trehalose or proline. Most class A strains carried suppressor mutations which arose during their derivation from the wild type, whereas the osmodefective strains of class B were suppressor free. When amber suppressor mutations at the supD, supE, or supF loci were introduced into such sup0 osmodefective strains, they became osmotolerant and gained the ability to accumulate trehalose in response to elevated medium osmolarity. It appears that the original K-12 strain of E. coli carries an amber mutation in a gene affecting osmoregulation. Mutants lacking ADP-glucose synthetase (glgC) accumulated trehalose normally, whereas mutants lacking UDP-glucose synthetase (galU) did not make trehalose and grew poorly in medium of high osmolarity. Trehalose synthesis was repressed by exogenous glycine betaine but not by proline.},

This compares to a previous study by the authors which showed that seven out of forty serovar Enteritidis phage type (PT) 4 strains were more sensitive. RpoS activity was examined indirectly in selected strains of DT 104 and PT 4. In those with normal stress resistance a 100-fold induction of an RpoS-dependent spvR/A:'::luxCDABE fusion was observed upon entry into stationary phase. The sensitive strains examined showed either no induction or a reduced level of spvR/A:'::luxCDABE expression. The rpoS gene was sequenced from these strains and three were found to harbour mutations including one deletion, one base-pair substitution resulting in a nonsense codon, and one insertion causing a frameshift resulting in an early stop codon. Strains with negligible or reduced spvR/A:'::luxCDABE expression had low stress resistance. All strains of DT 104 could be recovered from liver and spleen tissues of infected hens 14 d post-infection, but one with no induction of spvR/A:'::luxCDABE expression was significantly less likely to be recovered from chicken reproductive tissues, liver or spleen than the majority of other strains, including one with reduced spvR/A:'::luxCDABE expression. This work has demonstrated that clinical and environmental strains of DT 104 and PT 4 not infrequently harbour mutations in the rpoS allele. It is possible that the rpoS mutations may have occurred during the initial isolation of the strains. The ability of a strain to cause infection, however, also depends on factors such as host susceptibility and dose.},

We have initiated a study of genetic changes in these archival cultures. We chose to start with examination of the rpoS gene since, among gram-negative bacteria, many genes needed for survival are regulated by RpoS, the stationary-phase sigma factor. In each of 27 vials examined, cells had the rpoS start codon UUG instead of the expected AUG of Salmonella and Escherichia coli strains recorded in GenBank. Ten of the 27 had additional mutations in the rpoS gene compared with the X77752 wild-type strain currently recorded in GenBank. The rpoS mutations in the 10 strains included two deletions as well as point mutations that altered amino acid sequences substantially. Since these stored strains were derived from ancestral cells inoculated decades ago and remained undisturbed, it is assumed that the 10 rpoS mutations occurred during storage. Since the remaining 17 sequences were wild type (other than in the start codon), it is obvious that rpoS remained relatively stable during decades of sealed storage.},

   Abstract = {The sigmaS and sigma70 subunits of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase recognize very similar promoter sequences. Therefore, many promoters can be activated by both holoenzymes in vitro. The same promoters, however, often exhibit distinct sigma factor selectivity in vivo. It has been shown that high salt conditions, reduced negative supercoiling and the formation of complex nucleoprotein structures in a promoter region can contribute to or even generate sigmaS selectivity. Here, we characterize the first positively acting sigmaS-selective feature in the promoter sequence itself. Using the sigmaS-dependent csiD promoter as a model system, we demonstrate that C and T at the -13 and -14 positions, respectively, result in strongest expression. We provide allele-specific suppression data indicating that these nucleotides are contacted by K173 in region 2.5 of sigmaS. In contrast, sigma70, which features a glutamate at the corresponding position (E458), as well as the sigmaS(K173E) variant, exhibit a preference for a G(-13). C(-13) is highly conserved in sigmaS-dependent promoters, and additional data with the osmY promoter demonstrate that the K173/C(-13) interaction is of general importance. In conclusion, our data demonstrate an important role for region 2.5 in sigmaS in transcription initiation. Moreover, we propose a consensus sequence for a sigmaS-selective promoter and discuss its emergence and functional properties from an evolutionary point of view.},

   Abstract = {Sequence determinants responsible for promoter recognition by RNA polymerase holoenzyme containing sigma 38, the rpoS gene product, were analyzed. In a previous study [Tanaka et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90, 3511-3515], Escherichia coli promoters were classified into three groups: promoters recognized only by RNA polymerase holoenzyme containing sigma 70 (E sigma 70); promoters recognized preferentially by that containing sigma 38 (E sigma 38); promoters recognized by both E sigma 70 and E sigma 38. As representatives of each group of promoter, we chose the alaS, fic and lacUV5 promoters. Making use of a restriction enzyme site inserted between the -10 and -35 hexamer sequences, promoters were divided into the upstream (UE) and downstream (DE) elements. These UEs and DEs were combined in all possible combinations and used for in vitro transcription reactions. Promoters containing DE from the fic or lacUV5 promoter were found to be recognized by E sigma 38, while those containing DE from the alaS promoter were not. Moreover, fic DE alone functioned as an efficient promoter for E sigma 38. Thus we conclude that the discrimination signal resides within the DE sequence. To test the activator response of E sigma 38, in vitro transcription reactions were also performed with the gal and lac promoters. For both CRP-responsive P1 promoters, E sigma 38 was found to be activated by the CRP-cAMP complex.},

   Abstract = {Transcription of the gene osmE of Escherichia coli is inducible by elevated osmotic pressure and during the decelerating phase of growth. osmE expression is directed by a single promoter, osmEp. Decelerating phase induction of osmEp is dependent on the sigmas (RpoS) factor, whereas its osmotic induction is independent of sigmas. Purified Esigmas and Esigma70 were both able to transcribe osmEp in vitro on supercoiled templates. In the presence of rpoD800, a mutation resulting in a thermosensitive sigma70 factor, a shift to non-permissive temperature abolished induction of osmEp after an osmotic shock during exponential phase, but did not affect the decelerating phase induction. Point mutations affecting osmEp activity were isolated. Down-promoter mutations decreased transcription in both the presence and the absence of sigmas, indicating that the two forms of RNA polymerase holoenzyme recognize very similar sequence determinants on the osmE promoter. Three up-promoter mutations brought osmEp closer to the consensus of Esigma70-dependent promoters. The two variant promoters exhibiting the highest efficiency became essentially independent of sigmas in vivo. Our data suggest that Esigmas transcribes wild-type osmEp with a higher efficiency than Esigma70. A model in which an intrinsic differential recognition contributes to growth phase-dependent regulation is proposed. Generalization of this model to other sigmas-dependent promoters is discussed.},

   Abstract = {Although more than 30 Escherichia coli promoters utilize the RNA polymerase holoenzyme containing sigmaS (EsigmaS), and it is known that there is some overlap between the promoters recognized by EsigmaS and by the major E. coli holoenzyme (Esigma70), the sequence elements responsible for promoter recognition by EsigmaS are not well understood. To define the DNA sequences recognized best by EsigmaS in vitro, we started with random DNA and enriched for EsigmaS promoter sequences by multiple cycles of binding and selection. Surprisingly, the sequences selected by EsigmaS contained the known consensus elements (-10 and -35 hexamers) for recognition by Esigma70. Using genetic and biochemical approaches, we show that EsigmaS and Esigma70 do not achieve specificity through 'best fit' to different consensus promoter hexamers, the way that other forms of holoenzyme limit transcription to discrete sets of promoters. Rather, we suggest that EsigmaS-specific promoters have sequences that differ significantly from the consensus in at least one of the recognition hexamers, and that promoter discrimination against Esigma70 is achieved, at least in part, by the two enzymes tolerating different deviations from consensus. DNA recognition by EsigmaS versus Esigma70 thus presents an alternative solution to the problem of promoter selectivity.},

   Abstract = {The promoter (amyP) of the Bacillus subtilis alpha-amylase gene, which is recognized by E sigma A, has a three out of six match to the consensus promoter in both the -35 and -10 hexamers. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to identify important bases for promoter utilization in the spacer sequence between the hexamers. Mutations in the sequence TGTG extending from positions -18 to -15 (the -16 region) caused a 5-94-fold decrease in alpha-amylase production. A G-C transversion at position -15 was the most detrimental mutation: it essentially eliminated amyP utilization in B. subtilis and in Escherichia coli. Mutating the -35 and -10 hexamers to the E sigma A consensus promoter increased alpha-amylase production 56-fold in B. subtilis and fivefold in E. coli. Introducing the -15 G to C transversion into the consensus promoter reduced alpha-amylase production threefold, in contrast to the 94-fold reduction for the wild-type promoter in B. subtilis. The -15 G to C transversion did not reduce alpha-amylase synthesis directed by the consensus promoter in E. coli. The alpha-amylase gene is subject to two forms of transcriptional regulation: catabolite repression and temporal regulation. None of the mutants constructed in this study had any effect on either type of regulation. The -16 region, especially the G at position -15, appears to be moderately conserved in B. subtilis and in other Gram-positive organisms and weakly conserved in E. coli. The evidence suggests that the -16 region is an additional region of E sigma A promoters in B. subtilis and E sigma 70 promoters in E. coli, essential in some weak promoters such as the alpha-amylase promoter but, of little benefit to very strong promoters.},

   Abstract = {At some bacterial promoters, a 5'-TG-3' sequence element, located one base upstream of the -10 hexamer element, provides an essential motif necessary for transcription initiation. We have identified a mutant of the Escherichia coli RNA polymerase sigma70 subunit that has an altered preference for base sequences in this 'extended -10' region. We show that this mutant sigma70 subunit substantially increases transcription from promoters bearing 5'-TC-3' or 5'-TT-3' instead of a 5'-TG-3' motif, located one base upstream of the -10 hexamer. The mutant results from a single base pair substitution in the rpoD gene that causes a Glu to Gly change at position 458 of sigma70. This substitution identifies a functional region in sigma70 that is immediately adjacent to the well-characterized region 2.4 (positions 434-453, previously shown to contact the -10 hexamer). From these results, we conclude that this region (which we name region 2.5) is involved in contacting the 5'-TG-3' motif found at some bacterial promoters: thus, extended -10 regions are recognized by an extended region 2 of the RNA polymerase sigma70 subunit.},

   Abstract = {The degradation of the RpoS (sigmaS) subunit of RNA polymerase in Escherichia coli is a prime example of regulated proteolysis in prokaryotes. RpoS turnover depends on ClpXP protease, the response regulator RssB, and a hitherto uncharacterized &quot;turnover element&quot; within RpoS itself. Here we localize the turnover element to a small element (around the crucial amino acid lysine-173) directly downstream of the promoter-recognizing region 2.4 in RpoS. Its sequence as well as its location identify the turnover element as a unique proteolysis-promoting motif. This element is shown to be a site of interaction with RssB. Thus, RssB is functionally unique among response regulators as a direct recognition factor in ClpXP-dependent RpoS proteolysis. Binding of RssB to RpoS is stimulated by phosphorylation of the RssB receiver domain, suggesting that environmental stress affects RpoS proteolysis by modulating RssB affinity for RpoS. Initial evidence indicates that lysine-173 in RpoS, besides being essential of RpoS proteolysis, may play a role in promoter recognition. Thus the same region in RpoS is crucial for proteolysis as well as for activity as a transcription factor.},

We have analysed open complexes of Esigma(S) RNA polymerase, using sigma(S) derivatives carrying single cysteine residues at nine different positions to which the reagent FeBABE has been tethered. All holoenzymes but one formed transcriptionally active open complexes at three different promoters (osmY, galP1 and lacUV5). The chemical nuclease FeBABE can cleave DNA in proximity to the chelate. The overall cutting pattern of Esigma(S) open complexes does not depend on the nature of the promoter and is similar to that obtained with Esigma(70), but extends towards the downstream part of the promoter. The strongest cleavages are observed with FeBABE positioned on cysteines in regions 2.2 to 3.1. In contrast to sigma(70), region 2.1 of sigma(S) appears to be far from DNA. Region 4.2 of sigma(S) appears less accessible than its counterpart in sigma(70) and FeBABE positioned in the turn of the helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif in region 4.2 reacts only weakly with the -35 promoter element. This provides a structural basis for the minor role of the -35 sequence in sigma(S)-dependent promoter recognition.},

Duplex recognition was found to be much weaker than that observed in sigma70 promoter usage. However, binding to fork junction probes, which attempt to mimic melted DNA, was very strong. This binding occurs via the non-template strand with the identity of the two conserved junction nucleotides (-12T and -11A) being of paramount importance. A modified promoter consensus sequence identified these two nucleotides as among only four (underlined) that are highly conserved, and all four were in the -10 region (CTAcacT from -13 to -7). The remaining two nucleotides were shown to have different roles, -13C in preventing recognition by the heterologous sigma70 polymerase and -7T in directing enzyme isomerization. These -10 region nucleotides appear to have their primary function prior to full melting because probes that had a melted start site were relatively insensitive to substitution at these positions. These results suggest the sigma38 mechanism differs from the sigma70 mechanism, and this difference likely contributes to selective use of sigma38 under conditions that exist during stationery phase.},
