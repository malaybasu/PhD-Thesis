   Abstract = {Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5, a rhizosphere-inhabiting bacterium that suppresses several soilborne pathogens of plants, produces the antibiotics pyrrolnitrin, pyoluteorin, and 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol. A gene necessary for pyrrolnitrin production by Pf-5 was identified as rpoS, which encodes the stationary-phase sigma factor sigma s. Several pleiotropic effects of an rpoS mutation in Escherichia coli also were observed in an RpoS- mutant of Pf-5. These included sensitivities of stationary-phase cells to stresses imposed by hydrogen peroxide or high salt concentration. A plasmid containing the cloned wild-type rpoS gene restored pyrrolnitrin production and stress tolerance to the RpoS- mutant of Pf-5. The RpoS- mutant overproduced pyoluteorin and 2,4-diacetyl-phloroglucinol, two antibiotics that inhibit growth of the phytopathogenic fungus Pythium ultimum, and was superior to the wild type in suppression of seedling damping-off of cucumber caused by Pythium ultimum. When inoculated onto cucumber seed at high cell densities, the RpoS- mutant did not survive as well as the wild-type strain on surfaces of developing seedlings. Other stationary-phase-specific phenotypes of Pf-5, such as the production of cyanide and extracellular protease(s) were expressed by the RpoS- mutant, suggesting that sigma s is only one of the sigma factors required for the transcription of genes in stationary-phase cells of P. fluorescens. These results indicate that a sigma factor encoded by rpoS influences antibiotic production, biological control activity, and survival of P. fluorescens on plant surfaces.},

   Abstract = {In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the production of many virulence factors and secondary metabolites is regulated in concert with cell density through quorum sensing. Two quorum-sensing regulons have been identified in which the LuxR homologues LasR and RhlR are activated by N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (OdDHL) and N-butanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (BHL) respectively. The lasR and rhlR genes are linked to the luxl homologues lasl and rhll, which are responsible for synthesis of OdDHL and BHL, respectively. As lasRl and rhlRl are both involved in regulating synthesis of exoenzymes such as elastase, we sought to determine the nature of their interrelationship. By using lacZ transcriptional fusions in both homologous (P. aeruginosa) and heterologous (Escherichia coli) genetic backgrounds we provide evidence that (i) lasR is expressed constitutively throughout the growth cycle, (ii) rhlR expression is regulated by LasR/OdDHL, and (iii) that RhlR/BHL regulates rhll. We also show that expression of the stationary-phase sigma factor gene rpoS is abolished in a P. aeruginosa lasR mutant and in the pleiotropic BHL-negative mutant PANO67. Furthermore, our data reveal that kin E. coli, an rpoS-lacZ fusion is regulated directly by RhlR/BHL. Taken together, these results indicate that P. aeruginosa employs a multilayered hierarchical quorum-sensing cascade involving RhlR/BHL and LasR/OdDHL, interlinked via RpoS, to integrate the regulation of virulence determinants and secondary metabolites with adaptation and survival in the stationary phase.},

A two-component regulatory system comprised of the sensor kinase GacS (previously called ApdA or LemA) and GacA, a member of the FixJ family of response regulators, is required for antibiotic production. A mutation in rpoS, which encodes the stationary-phase sigma factor sigmaS, differentially affects antibiotic production and reduces the capacity of stationary-phase cells of P. fluorescens to survive exposure to oxidative stress. The gacA gene of P. fluorescens Pf-5 was isolated, and the influence of gacS and gacA on rpoS transcription, sigmaS levels, and oxidative stress response of Pf-5 was determined. We selected a gacA mutant of Pf-5 that contained a single nucleotide substitution within a predicted alpha-helical region, which is highly conserved among the FixJ family of response regulators. At the entrance to stationary phase, sigmaS content in gacS and gacA mutants of Pf-5 was less than 20% of the wild-type level. Transcription of rpoS, assessed with an rpoS-lacZ transcriptional fusion, was positively influenced by GacS and GacA, an effect that was most evident at the transition between exponential growth and stationary phase. Mutations in gacS and gacA compromised the capacity of stationary-phase cells of Pf-5 to survive exposure to oxidative stress. The results of this study provide evidence for the predominant roles of GacS and GacA in the regulatory cascade controlling stress response and antifungal metabolite production in P. fluorescens.},

Disruption of the rpoS gene resulted in a two- to threefold increase in the rate of kill of stationary-phase cells. The rpoS mutant also survived less well than the parental strain during the initial phase of carbon or phosphate-carbon starvation. However, after 25 d starvation the remaining population of culturable cells was not significantly different. Stationary-phase cells of the RpoS-negative strain were much more stress resistant than exponentially growing RpoS-positive cells, suggesting that factors other than the RpoS protein must be associated with stationary-phase stress tolerance in P. aeruginosa. Comparison of two-dimensional PAGE of the rpoS mutant and the parental strain showed four major modifications of protein patterns associated with the rpoS mutation.},

   Abstract = {The sigma factor RpoS (sigmaS) has been described as a general stress response regulator that controls the expression of genes which confer increased resistance to various stresses in some gram-negative bacteria. To elucidate the role of RpoS in Pseudomonas aeruginosa physiology and pathogenesis, we constructed rpoS mutants in several strains of P. aeruginosa, including PAO1. The PAO1 rpoS mutant was subjected to various environmental stresses, and we compared the resistance phenotype of the mutant to that of the parent. The PAO1 rpoS mutant was slightly more sensitive to carbon starvation than the wild-type strain, but this phenotype was obvious only when the cells were grown in a medium supplemented with glucose as the sole carbon source. In addition, the PAO1 rpoS mutant was hypersensitive to heat shock at 50 degrees C, increased osmolarity, and prolonged exposure to high concentrations of H2O2. In accordance with the hypersensitivity to H2O2, catalase production was 60% lower in the rpoS mutant than in the parent strain. We also assessed the role of RpoS in the production of several exoproducts known to be important for virulence of P. aeruginosa. The rpoS mutant produced 50% less exotoxin A, but it produced only slightly smaller amounts of elastase and LasA protease than the parent strain. The levels of phospholipase C and casein-degrading proteases were unaffected by a mutation in rpoS in PAO1. The rpoS mutation resulted in the increased production of the phenazine antibiotic pyocyanin and the siderophore pyoverdine. This increased pyocyanin production may be responsible for the enhanced virulence of the PAO1 rpoS mutant that was observed in a rat chronic-lung-infection model. In addition, the rpoS mutant displayed an altered twitching-motility phenotype, suggesting that the colonization factors, type IV fimbriae, were affected. Finally, in an alginate-overproducing cystic fibrosis (CF) isolate, FRD1, the rpoS101::aacCI mutation almost completely abolished the production of alginate when the bacterium was grown in a liquid medium. On a solid medium, the FRD1 rpoS mutant produced approximately 70% less alginate than did the wild-type strain. Thus, our data indicate that although some of the functions of RpoS in P. aeruginosa physiology are similar to RpoS functions in other gram-negative bacteria, it also has some functions unique to this bacterium.},

   Abstract = {In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, many exoproduct virulence determinants are regulated via a hierarchical quorum-sensing cascade involving the transcriptional regulators LasR and RhlR and their cognate activators, N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (3O-C12-HSL) and N-butanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (C4-HSL). In this paper, we demonstrate that the cytotoxic lectins PA-IL and PA-IIL are regulated via quorum sensing. Using immunoblot analysis, the production of both lectins was found to be directly dependent on the rhl locus while, in a lasR mutant, the onset of lectin synthesis was delayed but not abolished. The PA-IL structural gene, lecA, was cloned and sequenced. Transcript analysis indicated a monocistronic organization with a transcriptional start site 70 bp upstream of the lecA translational start codon. A lux box-type element together with RpoS (sigma(S)) consensus sequences was identified upstream of the putative promoter region. In Escherichia coli, expression of a lecA::lux reporter fusion was activated by RhlR/C4-HSL, but not by LasR/3O-C12-HSL, confirming direct regulation by RhlR/C4-HSL. Similarly, in P. aeruginosa PAO1, the expression of a chromosomal lecA::lux fusion was enhanced but not advanced by the addition of exogenous C4-HSL but not 3O-C12-HSL. Furthermore, mutation of rpoS abolished lectin synthesis in P. aeruginosa, demonstrating that both RpoS and RhlR/C4-HSL are required. Although the C4-HSL-dependent expression of the lecA::lux reporter in E. coli could be inhibited by the presence of 3O-C12-HSL, this did not occur in P. aeruginosa. This suggests that, in the homologous genetic background, 3O-C12-HSL does not function as a posttranslational regulator of the RhlR/C4-HSL-dependent activation of lecA expression.},

   Abstract = {The rpoS gene encodes the sigma factor which was identified in several gram-negative bacteria as a central regulator during stationary phase. rpoS gene regulation is known to respond to cell density, showing higher expression in stationary phase. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, it has been demonstrated that the cell-density-dependent regulation response known as quorum sensing interacts with this regulatory response. Using the rpoS promoter of P. putida, we identified a genomic Tn5 insertion mutant of P. putida which showed a 90% decrease in rpoS promoter activity, resulting in less RpoS being present in a cell at stationary phase. Molecular analysis revealed that this mutant carried a Tn5 insertion in a gene, designated psrA (Pseudomonas sigma regulator), which codes for a protein (PsrA) of 26.3 kDa. PsrA contains a helix-turn-helix motif typical of DNA binding proteins and belongs to the TetR family of bacterial regulators. The homolog of the psrA gene was identified in P. aeruginosa; the protein showed 90% identity to PsrA of P. putida. A psrA::Tn5 insertion mutant of P. aeruginosa was constructed. In both Pseudomonas species, psrA was genetically linked to the SOS lexA repressor gene. Similar to what was observed for P. putida, a psrA null mutant of P. aeruginosa also showed a 90% reduction in rpoS promoter activity; both mutants could be complemented for rpoS promoter activity when the psrA gene was provided in trans. psrA mutants of both Pseudomonas species lost the ability to induce rpoS expression at stationary phase, but they retained the ability to produce quorum-sensing autoinducer molecules. PsrA was demonstrated to negatively regulate psrA gene expression in Pseudomonas and in Escherichia coli as well as to be capable of activating the rpoS promoter in E. coli. Our data suggest that PsrA is an important regulatory protein of Pseudomonas spp. involved in the regulatory cascade controlling rpoS gene regulation in response to cell density.},

   Abstract = {During nutrient starvation, Escherichia coli elicits a stringent response involving the ribosome-associated protein RelA. Activation of RelA results in a global change in the cellular metabolism including enhanced expression of the stationary-phase sigma factor RpoS. In the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a complex quorum-sensing circuitry, linked to RpoS expression, is required for cell density-dependent production of many secreted virulence factors, including LasB elastase. Quorum sensing relies on the activation of specific transcriptional regulators (LasR and RhlR) by their corresponding autoinducers (3-oxo-C(12)-homoserine lactone [HSL] and C(4)-HSL), which function as intercellular signals. We found that overexpression of relA activated the expression of rpoS in P. aeruginosa and led to premature, cell density-independent LasB elastase production. We therefore investigated the effects of the stringent response on quorum sensing. Both lasR and rhlR gene expression and autoinducer synthesis were prematurely activated during the stringent response induced by overexpression of relA. Premature expression of lasR and rhlR was also observed when relA was overexpressed in a PAO1 rpoS mutant. The stringent response induced by the amino acid analogue serine hydroxamate (SHX) also led to premature production of the 3-oxo-C(12)-HSL autoinducer. This response to SHX was absent in a PAO1 relA mutant. These findings suggest that the stringent response can activate the two quorum-sensing systems of P. aeruginosa independently of cell density.},

In contrast, Hfq is also required for efficient translation of the E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium rpoS gene, encoding the stationary sigma factor. In this study, the authors have isolated and characterized the Hfq homologue of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Hfq(Pa)), which consists of only 82 aa. The 68 N-terminal amino acids of Hfq(Pa) show 92% identity with Hfq(Ec). Hfq(Pa) was shown to functionally replace Hfq(Ec) in terms of its requirement for phage Qbeta replication and for rpoS expression. In addition, Hfq(Pa) exerted the same negative effect on E. coli ompA mRNA expression. As judged by proteome analysis, the expression of either the plasmid-borne hfq(Pa) or the hfq(Ec) gene in an E. coli Hfq(-) RpoS(-) strain revealed no gross difference in the protein profile. Both Hfq(Ec) and Hfq(Pa) affected the synthesis of approximately 26 RpoS-independent E. coli gene products. These studies showed that the functional domain of Hfq resides within its N-terminal domain. The observation that a C-terminally truncated Hfq(Ec) lacking the last 27 aa [Hfq(Ec(75))] can also functionally replace the full-length E. coli protein lends further support to this notion.},

   Abstract = {In Pseudomonas fluorescens CHA0, an antagonist of root-pathogenic fungi, the GacS/GacA two-component system tightly controls the expression of antifungal secondary metabolites and exoenzymes at a posttranscriptional level, involving the RNA-binding protein and global regulator of secondary metabolism RsmA. This protein was purified from P. fluorescens, and RNA bound to it was converted to cDNA, which served as a probe to isolate the corresponding chromosomal locus, rsmZ. This gene encoded a regulatory RNA of 127 nucleotides and a truncated form lacking 35 nucleotides at the 3' end. Expression of rsmZ depended on GacA, increased with increasing population density, and was stimulated by the addition of a solvent-extractable extracellular signal produced by strain CHA0 at the end of exponential growth. This signal appeared to be unrelated to N-acyl-homoserine lactones. A conserved upstream element in the rsmZ promoter, but not the stress sigma factor RpoS, was involved in rsmZ expression. Overexpression of rsmZ effectively suppressed the negative effect of gacS and gacA mutations on target genes, i.e., hcnA (for hydrogen cyanide synthase) and aprA (for the major exoprotease). Mutational inactivation of rsmZ resulted in reduced expression of these target genes in the presence of added signal. Overexpression of rsmA had a similar, albeit stronger negative effect. These results support a model in which GacA upregulates the expression of regulatory RNAs, such as RsmZ of strain CHA0, in response to a bacterial signal. By a titration effect, RsmZ may then alleviate the repressing activity of RsmA on the expression of target mRNAs.},

   Journal = {Mol Microbiol},
   Volume = {28},
   Number = {5},
   Pages = {917-29.},
   Abstract = {The genes lemA (which we here redesignate gacS) and gacA encode members of a widely conserved two-component regulatory system. In Pseudomonas syringae strain B728a, gacS and gacA are required for lesion formation on bean, as well as for the production of protease and the toxin syringomycin. A gene, designated salA, was discovered that restored syringomycin production to a gacS mutant when present on a multiple-copy plasmid. Disruption of chromosomal salA resulted in loss of syringomycin production and lesion formation in laboratory assays. Sequence analysis of salA suggests that it encodes a protein with a DNA-binding motif but without other significant similarity to proteins in current databases. Chromosomal reporter fusions revealed that gacS and gacA positively regulate salA, that salA upregulates its own expression and that salA positively regulates the expression of a syringomycin biosynthetic gene, syrB. Loss of syringomycin production does not account for the salA mutant's attenuated pathogenicity, as a syrB mutant was found to retain full virulence. The salA gene did not similarly suppress the protease deficient phenotype of gacS mutants, nor were salA mutants affected for protease production. A gacS/gacA-dependent homoserine lactone activity as detected by bioassay was also unaffected by the disruption of salA. Thus, salA appears to encode a novel regulator that activates the expression of at least two separate genetic subsets of the gacS/gacA regulon, one pathway leading to syringomycin production and the other resulting in plant disease.},
