The deduced amino acid sequence reveals a protein of 733 residues which has extensive amino acid homology with the principal sigma factors of a number of divergent prokaryotes. It is larger than most sigma factors identified to date, having a molecular mass of 81.3 kDa. We have designated this factor sigma 80. In a heterologous complementation assay, B. pertussis rpoD was able to complement the Escherichia coli rpoD temperature-sensitive mutant UQ285. Furthermore, B. pertussis rpoD conferred better specificity to the E. coli RNA polymerase, allowing increased expression of the B. pertussis virulence-associated tha promoter, but could not activate the ptx and cya promoters in the E. coli UQ285 strains carrying the B. pertussis bvg locus. We discuss the implications of these results on the mechanisms involved in the activation of virulence-associated promoters.},

The amplified fragment was cloned and used as a hybridization probe for cloning of the R. etli sigA gene. Sequencing data revealed an open reading frame of 2,055 bp showing extensive similarity to various vegetative sigma factors. The 5' end of the sigA transcript was determined and revealed a long, seemingly untranslated region of 170 nucleotides. Quantitative analysis of the sigA transcript by RNase protection and by primer extension assays indicated its down-regulation during entry into the stationary phase. On the basis of the structures of various vegetative sigma factors and considering previous information on heterologous expression, we speculate on the function of domain I of vegetative sigma factors.},

Several new sigma factor genes were cloned and sequenced to increase the variety of available sequences. Forty-two group 1 sigma factor sequences of various species were analyzed with the help of a distance matrix method to establish a phylogenetic tree. The tree derived by using sigma factors yielded subdivisions, including low-G+C and high-G+C gram-positive bacteria, cyanobacteria, and the alpha, beta, gamma, and delta subdivisions of proteobacteria, consistent with major bacterial groups found in trees derived from analyses with other molecules. However, some groupings (e.g., the chlamydiae, mycoplasmas, and green sulfur bacteria) are found in different positions than for trees obtained by using other molecular markers. A direct comparison to the most extensively used molecule in systematic studies, small-subunit rRNA, was made by deriving trees from essentially the same species set and using similar phylogenetic methods. Differences and similarities based on the two markers are discussed. Additionally, 31 group 2 sigma factors were analyzed in combination with the group 1 proteins in order to detect functional groupings of these alternative sigma factors. The data suggest that promoters recognized by the major vegetative sigma factors of eubacteria will contain sequence motifs and spacing very similar to those for the sigma70 sigma factors of Escherichia coli.},

We examined the influence of the -35 region sequence information on promoter function by shifting the wild type -35 region +/- 2 base pairs relative to the -10 region consensus sequence and by completely replacing it with alternative DNA sequences. In every case, the altered Pre* promoters retained transcriptional activity although differences in their transcriptional efficiencies were observed. Apparently the Pre* promoter does not require specific -35 region sequences for constitutive promoter activity, although the -35 region sequences can modulate overall promoter strength. In addition, by point mutation analysis we have identified bases immediately upstream of the -10 hexamer which are essential for constitutive function of the Pre* promoter. We propose that these mutants define an extended -10 region at Pre* that compensates for its poor -35 region sequence information by providing critical contacts that stabilize productive RNA polymerase binding.},

Promoter activity is greatest when the 'non-template' strand carries T and G at positions -15 and -14, respectively. Promoter activity can be further enhanced by a second T and G at positions -17 and -16, respectively, immediately upstream of the first 'TG motif'. Our results show that the base sequence of the DNA segment upstream of the -10 hexamer can make a significant contribution to promoter strength. Using published collections of characterised E.coli promoters, we have studied the frequency of occurrence of 'TG motifs' upstream of the promoters' -10 elements. We conclude that correctly placed 'TG motifs' are found at over 20% of E.coli promoters.},
