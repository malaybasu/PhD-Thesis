   Abstract = {A DNA fragment from Pseudomonas aeruginosa containing the rpoH gene encoding the heat-shock sigma factor sigma 32 has been cloned and sequenced. The gene is expressed in Escherichia coli and complements an rpoH- strain. An open reading frame encoding 284 amino acids shows 61% identity and 78% similarity to the RpoH protein of Escherichia coli.},
