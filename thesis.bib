   Abstract = {The Drosophila kelch gene produces a single transcript with a UGA stop codon separating two open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2). From the transcript, 76 kDa ORF1 and 160 kDa full-length (ORF1 + ORF2) proteins are made. The expression of these two proteins is regulated in a tissue-specific manner causing the ratio of full-length to ORF1 protein to vary in different tissues. The only detected defect for kelch mutants is female sterility, and kelch protein is localized to the ovarian ring canals. kelch mutant ring canals are disorganized and have partly occluded lumens, causing a failure to transport cytoplasm. ORF1 and full-length kelch proteins co-sediment with ring canals suggesting that both proteins are found in the ring canals. Transgenetic analysis reveals that ORF1 kelch protein is sufficient to rescue ring canal morphology and fertility. In addition, we have mutated the UGA stop codon to a UAA stop codon and to three sense codons that allow constitutive readthrough. Analysis of these mutants reveals that a full-length kelch protein can partially compensate for the loss of endogenous kelch, but the residue included at the stop codon is critical for function. Finally, these studies suggest that the mechanism of stop codon suppression of kelch is by tRNA suppression.},

   Abstract = {Primitive terrestrial life-defined as a chemical system able to transfer its molecular information via self-replication and to evolve-probably originated from the evolution of reduced organic molecules in liquid water. Several sources have been proposed for the prebiotic organic molecules: terrestrial primitive atmosphere (methane or carbon dioxide), deep-sea hydrothermal systems, and extraterrestrial meteoritic and cometary dust grains. The study of carbonaceous chondrites, which contain up to 5% by weight of organic matter, has allowed close examination of the delivery of extraterrestrial organic material. Eight proteinaceous amino acids have been identified in the Murchison meteorite among more than 70 amino acids. Engel reported that L-alanine was surprisingly more abundant than D-alanine in the Murchison meteorite. Cronin also found excesses of L-enantiomers for nonprotein amino acids. A large collection of micrometeorites has been recently extracted from Antarctic old blue ice. In the 50- to 100-micron size range, carbonaceous micrometeorites represent 80% of the samples and contain 2% of carbon, on average. They might have brought more carbon than that involved in the present surficial biomass. The early histories of Mars and Earth clearly show similarities. Liquid water was once stable on the surface of Mars, attesting the presence of an atmosphere capable of deccelerating C-rich micrometeorites. Therefore, primitive life may have developed on Mars as well and fossilized microorganisms may still be present in the near subsurface. The Viking missions to Mars in 1976 did not find evidence of either contemporary or past life, but the mass spectrometer on the lander aeroshell determined the atmospheric composition, which has allowed a family of meteorites to be identified as Martian. Although these samples are essentially volcanic in origin, it has been recognized that some of them contain carbonate inclusions and even veins that have a carbon isotopic composition indicative of an origin from Martian atmospheric carbon dioxide. The oxygen isotopic composition of these carbonate deposits allows calculation of the temperature regime existing during formation from a fluid that dissolved the carbon dioxide. As the composition of the fluid is unknown, only a temperature range can be estimated, but this falls between 0 degree and 90 degrees C, which would seem entirely appropriate for life processes. It was such carbonate veins that were found to host putative microfossils. Irrespective of the existence of features that could be considered to be fossils, carbonate-rich portions of Martian meteorites tend to have material, at more than 1000 ppm, that combusts at a low temperature; i.e., it is an organic form of carbon. Unfortunately, this organic matter does not have a diagnostic isotopic signature so it cannot be unambiguously said to be indigenous to the samples. However, many circumstantial arguments can be made to the effect that it is cogenetic with the carbonate and hence Martian. If it could be proved that the organic matter was preterrestrial, then the isotopic fractionation between it and the carbon is in the right sense for a biological origin.},

It grew at between 90 degrees C and 113 degrees C (optimum 106 degrees C) and pH 4.0-6.5 (optimum 5.5) and 1%-4% salt (optimum 1.7%). The organism was a facultatively aerobic obligate chemolithoautotroph gaining energy by H2-oxidation. Nitrate, S2O3(2-), and low concentrations of O2 (up to 0.3% v/v) served as electron acceptors, yielding NH4+, H2S, and H2O as end products, respectively. Growth was inhibited by acetate, pyruvate, glucose, starch, or sulfur. The new isolate was able to form colonies on plates (at 102 degrees C) and to grow at a pressure of 25000 kPa (250 bar). Exponentially growing cultures survived a one-hour autoclaving at 121 degrees C. The GC content was 53 mol%. The core lipids consisted of glycerol-dialkyl glycerol tetraethers and traces of 2,3-di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycerol. The cell wall was composed of a surface layer of tetrameric protein complexes arranged on a p4-lattice (center-to-center distance 18.5 nm). By its 16S rRNA sequence, the new isolate belonged to the Pyrodictiaceae. Based on its GC-content, DNA homology, S-layer composition, and metabolism, we describe here a new genus, which we name Pyrolobus (the "fire lobe"). The type species is Pyrolobus fumarii (type strain 1A; DSM 11204).},

Intracellular ice formation is believed to be fatal. This conclusion is based on studies of the cryopreservation of mammalian cells. Intracellular freezing has been observed in some living insect cells but has not been observed in intact animals. Nematodes are transparent and so the location of ice in their bodies can be observed directly using a cryomicroscope stage. We have observed freezing and melting in all body compartments, including intracellular compartments, of the Antarctic nematode Panagrolaimus davidi. Inoculative freezing from the surrounding water occurs via the body openings, rather than across the cuticle; most frequently it occurs via the excretory pore. Individual nematodes that have frozen intracellularly will subsequently grow and reproduce in culture. Determining the mechanisms by which this nematode survives intracellular freezing could have important applications in the cryopreservation of a variety of biological materials.},

The tree derived by using sigma factors yielded subdivisions, including low-G+C and high-G+C gram-positive bacteria, cyanobacteria, and the alpha, beta, gamma, and delta subdivisions of proteobacteria, consistent with major bacterial groups found in trees derived from analyses with other molecules. However, some groupings (e.g., the chlamydiae, mycoplasmas, and green sulfur bacteria) are found in different positions than for trees obtained by using other molecular markers. A direct comparison to the most extensively used molecule in systematic studies, small-subunit rRNA, was made by deriving trees from essentially the same species set and using similar phylogenetic methods. Differences and similarities based on the two markers are discussed. Additionally, 31 group 2 sigma factors were analyzed in combination with the group 1 proteins in order to detect functional groupings of these alternative sigma factors.

We examined the influence of the -35 region sequence information on promoter function by shifting the wild type -35 region +/- 2 base pairs relative to the -10 region consensus sequence and by completely replacing it with alternative DNA sequences. In every case, the altered Pre* promoters retained transcriptional activity although differences in their transcriptional efficiencies were observed. Apparently the Pre* promoter does not require specific -35 region sequences for constitutive promoter activity, although the -35 region sequences can modulate overall promoter strength. In addition, by point mutation analysis we have identified bases immediately upstream of the -10 hexamer which are essential for constitutive function of the Pre* promoter. We propose that these mutants define an extended -10 region at Pre* that compensates for its poor -35 region sequence information by providing critical contacts that stabilize productive RNA polymerase binding.},

Universally conserved residues important for -10 element recognition and melting lie on one face of sigma(2), while residues important for extended -10 recognition lie on sigma(3). Genetic studies correctly predicted that a helix-turn-helix motif in sigma(4) recognizes the -35 element but not the details of the protein-DNA interactions. Positive control mutants in sigma(4) cluster in two regions, positioned to interact with activators bound just upstream or downstream of the -35 element.},

   Abstract = {We have made a systematic study of how the activity of an Escherichia coli promoter is affected by the base sequence immediately upstream of the -10 hexamer. Starting with an activator-independent promoter, with a 17 bp spacing between the -10 and -35 hexamer elements, we constructed derivatives with all possible combinations of bases at positions -15 and -14. Promoter activity is greatest when the 'non-template' strand carries T and G at positions -15 and -14, respectively. Promoter activity can be further enhanced by a second T and G at positions -17 and -16, respectively, immediately upstream of the first 'TG motif'. Our results show that the base sequence of the DNA segment upstream of the -10 hexamer can make a significant contribution to promoter strength. Using published collections of characterised E.coli promoters, we have studied the frequency of occurrence of 'TG motifs' upstream of the promoters' -10 elements. We conclude that correctly placed 'TG motifs' are found at over 20% of E.coli promoters.},

By high-resolution S1 nuclease mapping, the 5'- and 3'-ends of rpoS mRNA were determined. The results indicated that rpoS is transcribed as a monocistronic mRNA. The sequence preceding the 5' end of rpoS mRNA showed poor homology to the consensus sequences of the previously known promoters. P. aeruginosa rpoS was not transcribed in E. coli.

Plasmids in mice that express hybrid insulin transgenes during development can be readily cloned into E. coli strains carrying mutations in two of the MDRS loci, mcrA and mcrB. In mice in which transgene expression is inappropriately delayed into adulthood, plasmids can only be cloned into E. coli that carry mutations in all known MDRS activities.

This assay is based upon the differential heat stabilities of the two enzymes and offers significant advantages over previous methods for quantitation of their activities. Measurement of catalase activities in extracts of various mutant strains confirmed the ability of this method to accurately distinguish the two activities. Contrary to previously published results, HPI catalase activity was observed to increase at stationary phase in strains lacking the stationary-phase sigma factor sigma(s) (RpoS). This increase was independent of OxyR and also occurred in a strain lacking the HPII structural gene, katE. These results suggest a potential novel pathway for HPI induction in response to increased oxidative stress in the absence of HPII. Measurement of HPII activity in strains carrying mutations in pcm (encoding the L-isoaspartyl protein methyltransferase) and surE led to the finding that these strains also have an amber mutation in rpoS; sequencing demonstrated the presence of this mutation in several commonly used laboratory strains of E. coli, including AB1157, W1485, and JC7623.},

   Abstract = {Obligate parasitic bacteria of the genus Chlamydia possess a developmental cycle that takes place entirely within eucaryotic host cells. Because standard methods of genetic analysis are not available for chlamydiae, an in vitro transcription system has been developed to elucidate the mechanisms by which chlamydiae regulate gene expression. The in vitro system is specific for chlamydial promoters but is inefficient, presumably because the RNA polymerase is not saturated with sigma factor. Therefore, we prepared recombinant Chlamydia psittaci 6BC major sigma factor to enhance transcription in the in vitro system. The gene encoding the major sigma factor (sigA) was identified by using an rpoD box oligonucleotide and was subsequently cloned and sequenced. It was found to encode a potential 571-amino-acid protein (sigma 66) that is greater than 90% identical to the previously identified major sigma factors from the L2 and MoPn strains of Chlamydia trachomatis. sigA was recloned into a T7 RNA polymerase expression system to produce large quantities of sigma 66 in Escherichia coli. Overexpressed sigma 66 was identified by immunoblot by using monoclonal antibodies 2G10 (reactive) and 2F8 (nonreactive) generated against E. coli sigma 70. After purification by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the recombinant protein was found to stimulate, by 10-fold or more, promoter-specific in vitro transcription by C. psittaci 6BC and C. trachomatis L2 RNA polymerases. Transcription was dependent on added chlamydial sigma 66, rather than on potentially contaminating E. coli sigma 70 or other fortuitous activators, since the monoclonal antibody 2G10, and not 2F8, inhibited transcription initiation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

The deduced protein encoded by sigF shows significant similarity to SigF sporulation sigma factors from Streptomyces coelicolor and Bacillus subtilis and to SigB, a stress-response sigma factor, from B. subtilis. Southern blot surveys with a sigF-specific probe identified cross-hybridizing bands in other slow-growing mycobacteria, Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and Mycobacterium avium, but not in the rapid-growers Mycobacterium smegmatis or Mycobacterium abscessus. RNase protection assays revealed that M. tuberculosis sigF mRNA is not present during exponential-phase growth in M. bovis BCG cultures but is strongly induced during stationary phase, nitrogen depletion, and cold shock. Weak expression of M. tuberculosis sigF was also detected during late-exponential phase, oxidative stress, anaerobiasis, and alcohol shock. The specific expression of M. tuberculosis sigF during stress or stationary phase suggests that it may play a role in the ability of tubercle bacilli to adapt to host defenses and persist during human infection.},

The rpoS gene of P. putida complemented the acid sensitivity and catalase deficiency of the rpoS mutant of E. coli and stimulated expression of the RpoS-controlled promoter, bolAp1. The gene was sequenced and found to be highly similar to the rpoS genes of other gram-negative bacteria. Like in other gram-negative bacteria, a homolog of the nlpD gene was found upstream to the rpoS gene. A transcriptional fusion of the promoter of the P. putida rpoS gene to the luxAB genes from Vibrio harveyi was constructed and used as an inactivated allele of rpoS for gene replacement of the wild-type copy in the chromosome of P. putida. The resultant rpoS mutant of P.putida, C1R1, showed reduced survival of carbon starvation and reduced cross-protection against other types of stress in cells starved for carbon, in particular after a challenge with ethanol. Survival in soil amended with m-methylbenzoate was also reduced in the mutant strain P. putida C1R1. The RpoS protein of P. putida controls the expression of more than 50 peptides, which are normally expressed in cells after a short period of carbon starvation.},

   Abstract = {Many of the changes in gene expression observed when Escherichia coli cells enter stationary phase are regulated at the level of transcription initiation. A group of stationary-phase-inducible promoters, known as "gearbox" promoter, display a characteristic sequence in the -10 region which differs greatly from the consensus sequence for sigma 70-dependent promoters. Here we describe our studies on the gearbox promoters bolAp1 and mcbAp, responsible for the temporally regulated transcription of bolA and the genes involved in the synthesis of the peptide antibiotic microcin B17, respectively. Deletion analysis of mcbAp demonstrated that the stationary-phase-inducible properties of this promoter are found in a DNA fragment extending from -54 to +11 bp, surrounding the transcriptional start site, and are separable from DNA sequences responsible for the OmpR-dependent stimulation of transcription of mcbAp. In vitro transcription studies indicate that the RNA polymerase holoenzyme involved in the transcription of mcbAp contains sigma 70. In this and an accompanying paper (R. Lange and R. Hengge-Aronis, J. Bacteriol. 173: 4474-4481, 1991), experiments are described which show that the product of katF, a global regulator of stationary-phase gene expression and a putative sigma factor, is required for the expression of bolAp1 fused to the reporter gene lacZ. In contrast, mcbAp appears to be negatively regulated by katF. We discuss the implications of these results for postexponential gene expression and the role of gearbox sequences in the regulation of promoter activity.},

Here we demonstrate that the histone-like protein H-NS is also a component of this network, in which it functions as a global inhibitor of gene expression during the exponential phase of growth. On two-dimensional gels, at least 22 sigma S-controlled proteins show increased expression in an hns mutant. H-NS also inhibits the expression of sigma S itself by a mechanism that acts at the posttranscriptional level. Our results indicate that relief of repression by H-NS plays a role in stationary-phase induction as well as in hyperosmotic induction of rpoS translation. Whereas certain sigma S-dependent genes (e.g., osmY) are only indirectly regulated by H-NS via its role in the control of sigma S expression, others are also H-NS-regulated in a sigma S-independent manner. (For this latter class of genes, rpoS hns double mutants show higher levels of expression than mutants deficient in rpoS alone.) In addition, we demonstrate that the slow-growth phenotype of hns mutants is suppressed in hns rpoS double mutants and that many second-site suppressor mutants that spontaneously arise from hns strains carry lesions that affect the expression of sigma S.},

Also, rpoS-dependent thermotolerance and resistance against hydrogen peroxide could be osmotically stimulated. In contrast, the expression of glgS, while exhibiting strong stationary-phase induction, was only weakly increased by elevated osmolarity, and several rpoS-dependent proteins previously identified on two-dimensional gels were not osmotically induced. During osmotic induction of rpoS-dependent genes, rpoS transcription and the level of sigma S remained unchanged. We conclude that osmotically regulated genes represent a subfamily within the rpoS regulon that requires differential regulation in addition to that provided by sigma S.},

Conserved domain 1.1 at the N-terminal end of sigma(70) has been shown to be essential for RNA polymerase function, and its deletion has been shown to result in a dominant-lethal phenotype. We now report that a sigma(S) variant with a deletion of its N-terminal 50 amino acids (sigma(S)Delta1-50), when expressed in vivo either from a chromosomal rpoS::IS10 allele (in rho mutant strains) or from a plasmid-borne arabinose-inducible promoter, is as proficient as the wild type in directing transcription from the proU P1 promoter; at three other sigma(S)-dependent promoters that were tested (osmY, katE, and csiD), the truncated protein exhibited a three- to sevenfold reduced range of activities. Catabolite repression at the csiD promoter (which requires both sigma(S) and cyclic AMP [cAMP]-cAMP receptor protein for its activity) was also preserved in the strain expressing sigma(S)Delta1-50. The intracellular content of sigma(S)Delta1-50 was regulated by culture variables such as growth phase, osmolarity, and temperature in the same manner as that described earlier for sigma(S), even when the truncated protein was expressed from a template that possessed neither the transcriptional nor the translational control elements of wild-type rpoS. Our results indicate that, unlike that in sigma(70), the N-terminal domain in sigma(S) may not be essential for the protein to function as a sigma factor in vivo. Furthermore, our results suggest that the induction of sigma(S)-specific promoters in stationary phase and during growth under conditions of high osmolarity or low temperature is mediated primarily through the regulation of sigma(S) protein degradation.},

   Abstract = {A genomic library derived from the deep-sea bacterium Photobacterium profundum SS9 was conjugally delivered into a previously isolated pressure-sensitive SS9 mutant, designated EC1002 (E. Chi and D. H. Bartlett, J. Bacteriol. 175:7533-7540, 1993), and exconjugants were screened for the ability to grow at 280-atm hydrostatic pressure. Several clones were identified that had restored high-pressure growth. The complementing DNA was localized and in all cases found to possess strong homology to recD, a DNA recombination and repair gene. EC1002 was found to be deficient in plasmid stability, a phenotype also seen in Escherichia coli recD mutants. The defect in EC1002 was localized to a point mutation that created a stop codon within the recD gene. Two additional recD mutants were constructed by gene disruption and were both found to possess a pressure-sensitive growth phenotype, although the magnitude of the defect depended on the extent of 3' truncation of the recD coding sequence. Surprisingly, the introduction of the SS9 recD gene into an E. coli recD mutant had two dramatic effects. At high pressure, SS9 recD enabled growth in the E. coli mutant strain under conditions of plasmid antibiotic resistance selection and prevented cell filamentation. Both of these effects were recessive to wild-type E. coli recD. These results suggest that the SS9 recD gene plays an essential role in SS9 growth at high pressure and that it may be possible to identify additional aspects of RecD function through the characterization of this activity.},

   Abstract = {The antimicrobial metabolite 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (2,4-DAPG) contributes to the capacity of Pseudomonas fluorescens strain CHA0 to control plant diseases caused by soilborne pathogens. A 2, 4-DAPG-negative Tn5 insertion mutant of strain CHA0 was isolated, and the nucleotide sequence of the 4-kb genomic DNA region adjacent to the Tn5 insertion site was determined. Four open reading frames were identified, two of which were homologous to phlA, the first gene of the 2,4-DAPG biosynthetic operon, and to the phlF gene encoding a pathway-specific transcriptional repressor. The Tn5 insertion was located in an open reading frame, tentatively named phlH, which is not related to known phl genes. In wild-type CHA0, 2, 4-DAPG production paralleled expression of a phlA'-'lacZ translational fusion, reaching a maximum in the late exponential growth phase. Thereafter, the compound appeared to be degraded to monoacetylphloroglucinol by the bacterium. 2,4-DAPG was identified as the active compound in extracts from culture supernatants of strain CHA0 specifically inducing phlA'-'lacZ expression about sixfold during exponential growth. Induction by exogenous 2,4-DAPG was most conspicuous in a phlA mutant, which was unable to produce 2, 4-DAPG. In a phlF mutant, 2,4-DAPG production was enhanced severalfold and phlA'-'lacZ was expressed at a level corresponding to that in the wild type with 2,4-DAPG added. The phlF mutant was insensitive to 2,4-DAPG addition. A transcriptional phlA-lacZ fusion was used to demonstrate that the repressor PhlF acts at the level of transcription. Expression of phlA'-'lacZ and 2,4-DAPG synthesis in strain CHA0 was strongly repressed by the bacterial extracellular metabolites salicylate and pyoluteorin as well as by fusaric acid, a toxin produced by the pythopathogenic fungus Fusarium. In the phlF mutant, these compounds did not affect phlA'-'lacZ expression and 2, 4-DAPG production. PhlF-mediated induction by 2,4-DAPG and repression by salicylate of phlA'-'lacZ expression was confirmed by using Escherichia coli as a heterologous host. In conclusion, our results show that autoinduction of 2,4-DAPG biosynthesis can be countered by certain bacterial (and fungal) metabolites. This mechanism, which depends on phlF function, may help P. fluorescens to produce homeostatically balanced amounts of extracellular metabolites.},

   Abstract = {The main sigma factor activating gene expression, necessary in stationary phase and under stress conditions, is sigma(S). In contrast to other minor sigma factors, RNA polymerase holoenzyme containing sigma(S) (Esigma(S)) recognizes a number of promoters which are also recognized by that containing sigma(70) (Esigma(70)). We have previously shown that transposon Tn4652 can activate silent genes in starving Pseudomonas putida cells by creating fusion promoters during transposition. The sequence of the fusion promoters is similar to the sigma(70)-specific promoter consensus. The -10 hexameric sequence and the sequence downstream from the -10 element differ among these promoters. We found that transcription from the fusion promoters is stationary phase specific. Based on in vivo experiments carried out with wild-type and rpoS-deficient mutant P. putida, the effect of sigma(S) on transcription from the fusion promoters was established only in some of these promoters. The importance of the sequence of the -10 hexamer has been pointed out in several published papers, but there is no information about whether the sequences downstream from the -10 element can affect sigma(S)-dependent transcription. Combination of the -10 hexameric sequences and downstream sequences of different fusion promoters revealed that sigma(S)-specific transcription from these promoters is not determined by the -10 hexameric sequence only. The results obtained in this study indicate that the sequence of the -10 element influences sigma(S)-specific transcription in concert with the sequence downstream from the -10 box.},

   Abstract = {The unique properties of nylon membranes allow for dramatic improvement in the capillary transfer of DNA restriction fragments from agarose gels (Southern blotting). By using 0.4 M NaOH as the transfer solvent following a short pre-treatment of the gel in acid, DNA is depurinated during transfer. Fragments of all sizes are eluted and retained quantitatively by the membrane; furthermore, the alkaline solvent induces covalent fixation of DNA to the membrane. The saving in time and materials afforded by this simple modification is accompanied by a marked improvement in resolution and a ten-fold increase in sensitivity of subsequent hybridization analyses. In addition, we have found that nylon membrane completely retains native (and denatured) DNA in transfer solvents of low ionic strength (including distilled water), although quantitative elution of DNA from the gel is limited to fragments smaller than 4 Kb. This property can be utilized in the direct electrophoretic transfer of native restriction fragments from polyacrylamide gels. Exposure of DNA to ultraviolet light, either in the gel or following transfer to nylon membrane, reduces its ability to hybridize.},

Heterogeneity was discovered with respect to two sigma subunits, sigma28 (sigmaF, the rpoF gene product) and sigma38 (sigmaS, the rpoS gene product). Five different types of W3110 were identified: A-type lineages have both sigma subunits in intact forms; B-type lineages carry a truncated sigma38 subunit and an intact sigma28 subunit; C-type lineages carry an intact sigma28 subunit but lack a sigma38 subunit; D-type lineages have only a sigma38 subunit without a sigma28 subunit; and E-type stocks lack both sigma subunits. All the lineages examined, however, contain the intact forms of sigma70 (sigmaD, the rpoD gene product) and sigma54 (sigmaN, the rpoN gene product). As expected from the lack of a sigma28 subunit, cells of D- and E-type lineages are nonmotile. The truncated form of the sigma38 subunit in B-type stocks carries two mutations near its N terminus and lacks C-terminal proximal region 4 due to an amber mutation. The failure of C- and E-type W3110 cells to express sigma38 and that of D- and E-type cells to express sigma28 were found to be due to defects in transcription even though the respective sigma subunit genes remain intact. These findings emphasize the importance of paying attention to possible variations in the genetic background between laboratory stocks originating from the same strain.},

The intervening region between mutS and rpoS was amplified by long-range PCR, and the resulting amplicons varied substantially in length (7.8 to 14.2 kb) among pathogenic groups. Restriction maps based on five enzymes and sequence analysis showed that strains of the EPEC 1, EPEC 2, and EHEC 2 groups have a long mutS-rpoS region composed of a ~6.0-kb DNA segment found in strain K-12 and a novel DNA segment (~2.9 kb) located at the 3' end of rpoS. The novel segment contains three genes (yclC, pad1, and slyA) that occur in E. coli O157:H7 and related strains but are not found in K-12 or members of the ECOR group A. Phylogenetic analysis of the common sequences indicates that the long intergenic region is ancestral and at least two separate deletion events gave rise to the shorter regions characteristic of the E. coli O157:H7 and K-12 lineages.},

The six non-K12 strains examined here had GAG, encoding glutamate, in position 33. The two most divergent strains had three and seven neutral substitutions in rpoS and carried insertions of 2100 and 2900 bp, respectively, just downstream of the gene. The genetic variations in rpoS were compared with the variation in RpoS-related phenotypes, by measuring catalase (KatE) activity, glycogen accumulation and acid phosphatase levels, and a katEp-gfp fusion was used to visualise katE gene transcription. The RpoS phenotypes of the six rpoS(33E) strains varied significantly more than that of the K12 rpoS(33Q) strains, especially with respect to acid phosphatase levels. This was due to the absence of the gene for the transcriptional activator AppY from four of the rpoS(33E) strains, while all the K12 derivatives carried this gene. When cloned into a LacI-controlled vector and compared in a rpoS::Tn 10 background, the RpoS(33Q) and RpoS(33E) variants showed the same activity.},

   Abstract = {When grown at high osmotic pressure, some strains of Escherichia coli K-12 synthesized substantial levels of free sugar and accumulated proline if it was present in the growth medium. The sugar was identified as trehalose by chemical reactivity, gas-liquid chromatography, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Strains of E. coli K-12 could be divided into two major classes with respect to osmoregulation. Those of class A showed a large increase in trehalose levels with increasing medium osmolarity and also accumulated proline from the medium, whereas those in class B showed no accumulation of trehalose or proline. Most class A strains carried suppressor mutations which arose during their derivation from the wild type, whereas the osmodefective strains of class B were suppressor free. When amber suppressor mutations at the supD, supE, or supF loci were introduced into such sup0 osmodefective strains, they became osmotolerant and gained the ability to accumulate trehalose in response to elevated medium osmolarity. It appears that the original K-12 strain of E. coli carries an amber mutation in a gene affecting osmoregulation. Mutants lacking ADP-glucose synthetase (glgC) accumulated trehalose normally, whereas mutants lacking UDP-glucose synthetase (galU) did not make trehalose and grew poorly in medium of high osmolarity. Trehalose synthesis was repressed by exogenous glycine betaine but not by proline.},

This compares to a previous study by the authors which showed that seven out of forty serovar Enteritidis phage type (PT) 4 strains were more sensitive. RpoS activity was examined indirectly in selected strains of DT 104 and PT 4. In those with normal stress resistance a 100-fold induction of an RpoS-dependent spvR/A:'::luxCDABE fusion was observed upon entry into stationary phase. The sensitive strains examined showed either no induction or a reduced level of spvR/A:'::luxCDABE expression. The rpoS gene was sequenced from these strains and three were found to harbour mutations including one deletion, one base-pair substitution resulting in a nonsense codon, and one insertion causing a frameshift resulting in an early stop codon. Strains with negligible or reduced spvR/A:'::luxCDABE expression had low stress resistance. All strains of DT 104 could be recovered from liver and spleen tissues of infected hens 14 d post-infection, but one with no induction of spvR/A:'::luxCDABE expression was significantly less likely to be recovered from chicken reproductive tissues, liver or spleen than the majority of other strains, including one with reduced spvR/A:'::luxCDABE expression. This work has demonstrated that clinical and environmental strains of DT 104 and PT 4 not infrequently harbour mutations in the rpoS allele. It is possible that the rpoS mutations may have occurred during the initial isolation of the strains. The ability of a strain to cause infection, however, also depends on factors such as host susceptibility and dose.},

We have initiated a study of genetic changes in these archival cultures. We chose to start with examination of the rpoS gene since, among gram-negative bacteria, many genes needed for survival are regulated by RpoS, the stationary-phase sigma factor. In each of 27 vials examined, cells had the rpoS start codon UUG instead of the expected AUG of Salmonella and Escherichia coli strains recorded in GenBank. Ten of the 27 had additional mutations in the rpoS gene compared with the X77752 wild-type strain currently recorded in GenBank. The rpoS mutations in the 10 strains included two deletions as well as point mutations that altered amino acid sequences substantially. Since these stored strains were derived from ancestral cells inoculated decades ago and remained undisturbed, it is assumed that the 10 rpoS mutations occurred during storage. Since the remaining 17 sequences were wild type (other than in the start codon), it is obvious that rpoS remained relatively stable during decades of sealed storage.},

In this study, we analyzed the function of the carboxy-terminal 16-amino-acid region of sigma(38) (residues 315 to 330), which is well conserved among the rpoS gene products of enteric bacterial species. Truncation of this region was shown to result in the loss of sigma activity in vivo using promoter-lacZ fusion constructs, but the mutant sigma(38) retained the binding activity in vivo to the core enzyme. The in vitro transcription analysis revealed that the transcription activity of sigma(38) holoenzyme under high potassium glutamate concentrations was significantly decreased by the truncation of the carboxy-terminal tail element.},

   Abstract = {The sigmaS and sigma70 subunits of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase recognize very similar promoter sequences. Therefore, many promoters can be activated by both holoenzymes in vitro. The same promoters, however, often exhibit distinct sigma factor selectivity in vivo. It has been shown that high salt conditions, reduced negative supercoiling and the formation of complex nucleoprotein structures in a promoter region can contribute to or even generate sigmaS selectivity. Here, we characterize the first positively acting sigmaS-selective feature in the promoter sequence itself. Using the sigmaS-dependent csiD promoter as a model system, we demonstrate that C and T at the -13 and -14 positions, respectively, result in strongest expression. We provide allele-specific suppression data indicating that these nucleotides are contacted by K173 in region 2.5 of sigmaS. In contrast, sigma70, which features a glutamate at the corresponding position (E458), as well as the sigmaS(K173E) variant, exhibit a preference for a G(-13). C(-13) is highly conserved in sigmaS-dependent promoters, and additional data with the osmY promoter demonstrate that the K173/C(-13) interaction is of general importance. In conclusion, our data demonstrate an important role for region 2.5 in sigmaS in transcription initiation. Moreover, we propose a consensus sequence for a sigmaS-selective promoter and discuss its emergence and functional properties from an evolutionary point of view.},

(1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90, 3511-3515], Escherichia coli promoters were classified into three groups: promoters recognized only by RNA polymerase holoenzyme containing sigma 70 (E sigma 70); promoters recognized preferentially by that containing sigma 38 (E sigma 38); promoters recognized by both E sigma 70 and E sigma 38. As representatives of each group of promoter, we chose the alaS, fic and lacUV5 promoters. Making use of a restriction enzyme site inserted between the -10 and -35 hexamer sequences, promoters were divided into the upstream (UE) and downstream (DE) elements. These UEs and DEs were combined in all possible combinations and used for in vitro transcription reactions. Promoters containing DE from the fic or lacUV5 promoter were found to be recognized by E sigma 38, while those containing DE from the alaS promoter were not. Moreover, fic DE alone functioned as an efficient promoter for E sigma 38. Thus we conclude that the discrimination signal resides within the DE sequence. To test the activator response of E sigma 38, in vitro transcription reactions were also performed with the gal and lac promoters. For both CRP-responsive P1 promoters, E sigma 38 was found to be activated by the CRP-cAMP complex.},

Decelerating phase induction of osmEp is dependent on the sigmas (RpoS) factor, whereas its osmotic induction is independent of sigmas. Purified Esigmas and Esigma70 were both able to transcribe osmEp in vitro on supercoiled templates. In the presence of rpoD800, a mutation resulting in a thermosensitive sigma70 factor, a shift to non-permissive temperature abolished induction of osmEp after an osmotic shock during exponential phase, but did not affect the decelerating phase induction. Point mutations affecting osmEp activity were isolated. Down-promoter mutations decreased transcription in both the presence and the absence of sigmas, indicating that the two forms of RNA polymerase holoenzyme recognize very similar sequence determinants on the osmE promoter. Three up-promoter mutations brought osmEp closer to the consensus of Esigma70-dependent promoters. The two variant promoters exhibiting the highest efficiency became essentially independent of sigmas in vivo. Our data suggest that Esigmas transcribes wild-type osmEp with a higher efficiency than Esigma70. A model in which an intrinsic differential recognition contributes to growth phase-dependent regulation is proposed. Generalization of this model to other sigmas-dependent promoters is discussed.},

To define the DNA sequences recognized best by EsigmaS in vitro, we started with random DNA and enriched for EsigmaS promoter sequences by multiple cycles of binding and selection. Surprisingly, the sequences selected by EsigmaS contained the known consensus elements (-10 and -35 hexamers) for recognition by Esigma70. Using genetic and biochemical approaches, we show that EsigmaS and Esigma70 do not achieve specificity through 'best fit' to different consensus promoter hexamers, the way that other forms of holoenzyme limit transcription to discrete sets of promoters. Rather, we suggest that EsigmaS-specific promoters have sequences that differ significantly from the consensus in at least one of the recognition hexamers, and that promoter discrimination against Esigma70 is achieved, at least in part, by the two enzymes tolerating different deviations from consensus. DNA recognition by EsigmaS versus Esigma70 thus presents an alternative solution to the problem of promoter selectivity.},

   Abstract = {The promoter (amyP) of the Bacillus subtilis alpha-amylase gene, which is recognized by E sigma A, has a three out of six match to the consensus promoter in both the -35 and -10 hexamers. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to identify important bases for promoter utilization in the spacer sequence between the hexamers. Mutations in the sequence TGTG extending from positions -18 to -15 (the -16 region) caused a 5-94-fold decrease in alpha-amylase production. A G-C transversion at position -15 was the most detrimental mutation: it essentially eliminated amyP utilization in B. subtilis and in Escherichia coli. Mutating the -35 and -10 hexamers to the E sigma A consensus promoter increased alpha-amylase production 56-fold in B. subtilis and fivefold in E. coli. Introducing the -15 G to C transversion into the consensus promoter reduced alpha-amylase production threefold, in contrast to the 94-fold reduction for the wild-type promoter in B. subtilis. The -15 G to C transversion did not reduce alpha-amylase synthesis directed by the consensus promoter in E. coli. The alpha-amylase gene is subject to two forms of transcriptional regulation: catabolite repression and temporal regulation. None of the mutants constructed in this study had any effect on either type of regulation. The -16 region, especially the G at position -15, appears to be moderately conserved in B. subtilis and in other Gram-positive organisms and weakly conserved in E. coli. The evidence suggests that the -16 region is an additional region of E sigma A promoters in B. subtilis and E sigma 70 promoters in E. coli, essential in some weak promoters such as the alpha-amylase promoter but, of little benefit to very strong promoters.},

We have identified a mutant of the Escherichia coli RNA polymerase sigma70 subunit that has an altered preference for base sequences in this 'extended -10' region. We show that this mutant sigma70 subunit substantially increases transcription from promoters bearing 5'-TC-3' or 5'-TT-3' instead of a 5'-TG-3' motif, located one base upstream of the -10 hexamer. The mutant results from a single base pair substitution in the rpoD gene that causes a Glu to Gly change at position 458 of sigma70. This substitution identifies a functional region in sigma70 that is immediately adjacent to the well-characterized region 2.4 (positions 434-453, previously shown to contact the -10 hexamer). From these results, we conclude that this region (which we name region 2.5) is involved in contacting the 5'-TG-3' motif found at some bacterial promoters: thus, extended -10 regions are recognized by an extended region 2 of the RNA polymerase sigma70 subunit.},

   Abstract = {The degradation of the RpoS (sigmaS) subunit of RNA polymerase in Escherichia coli is a prime example of regulated proteolysis in prokaryotes. RpoS turnover depends on ClpXP protease, the response regulator RssB, and a hitherto uncharacterized &quot;turnover element&quot; within RpoS itself. Here we localize the turnover element to a small element (around the crucial amino acid lysine-173) directly downstream of the promoter-recognizing region 2.4 in RpoS. Its sequence as well as its location identify the turnover element as a unique proteolysis-promoting motif. This element is shown to be a site of interaction with RssB. Thus, RssB is functionally unique among response regulators as a direct recognition factor in ClpXP-dependent RpoS proteolysis. Binding of RssB to RpoS is stimulated by phosphorylation of the RssB receiver domain, suggesting that environmental stress affects RpoS proteolysis by modulating RssB affinity for RpoS. Initial evidence indicates that lysine-173 in RpoS, besides being essential of RpoS proteolysis, may play a role in promoter recognition. Thus the same region in RpoS is crucial for proteolysis as well as for activity as a transcription factor.},

All holoenzymes but one formed transcriptionally active open complexes at three different promoters (osmY, galP1 and lacUV5). The chemical nuclease FeBABE can cleave DNA in proximity to the chelate. The overall cutting pattern of Esigma(S) open complexes does not depend on the nature of the promoter and is similar to that obtained with Esigma(70), but extends towards the downstream part of the promoter. The strongest cleavages are observed with FeBABE positioned on cysteines in regions 2.2 to 3.1. In contrast to sigma(70), region 2.1 of sigma(S) appears to be far from DNA. Region 4.2 of sigma(S) appears less accessible than its counterpart in sigma(70) and FeBABE positioned in the turn of the helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif in region 4.2 reacts only weakly with the -35 promoter element.

Duplex recognition was found to be much weaker than that observed in sigma70 promoter usage. However, binding to fork junction probes, which attempt to mimic melted DNA, was very strong. This binding occurs via the non-template strand with the identity of the two conserved junction nucleotides (-12T and -11A) being of paramount importance. A modified promoter consensus sequence identified these two nucleotides as among only four (underlined) that are highly conserved, and all four were in the -10 region (CTAcacT from -13 to -7). The remaining two nucleotides were shown to have different roles, -13C in preventing recognition by the heterologous sigma70 polymerase and -7T in directing enzyme isomerization. These -10 region nucleotides appear to have their primary function prior to full melting because probes that had a melted start site were relatively insensitive to substitution at these positions. These results suggest the sigma38 mechanism differs from the sigma70 mechanism, and this difference likely contributes to selective use of sigma38 under conditions that exist during stationery phase.},

Several pleiotropic effects of an rpoS mutation in Escherichia coli also were observed in an RpoS- mutant of Pf-5. These included sensitivities of stationary-phase cells to stresses imposed by hydrogen peroxide or high salt concentration. A plasmid containing the cloned wild-type rpoS gene restored pyrrolnitrin production and stress tolerance to the RpoS- mutant of Pf-5. The RpoS- mutant overproduced pyoluteorin and 2,4-diacetyl-phloroglucinol, two antibiotics that inhibit growth of the phytopathogenic fungus Pythium ultimum, and was superior to the wild type in suppression of seedling damping-off of cucumber caused by Pythium ultimum. When inoculated onto cucumber seed at high cell densities, the RpoS- mutant did not survive as well as the wild-type strain on surfaces of developing seedlings. Other stationary-phase-specific phenotypes of Pf-5, such as the production of cyanide and extracellular protease(s) were expressed by the RpoS- mutant, suggesting that sigma s is only one of the sigma factors required for the transcription of genes in stationary-phase cells of P. fluorescens.

   Abstract = {In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the production of many virulence factors and secondary metabolites is regulated in concert with cell density through quorum sensing. Two quorum-sensing regulons have been identified in which the LuxR homologues LasR and RhlR are activated by N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (OdDHL) and N-butanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (BHL) respectively. The lasR and rhlR genes are linked to the luxl homologues lasl and rhll, which are responsible for synthesis of OdDHL and BHL, respectively. As lasRl and rhlRl are both involved in regulating synthesis of exoenzymes such as elastase, we sought to determine the nature of their interrelationship. By using lacZ transcriptional fusions in both homologous (P. aeruginosa) and heterologous (Escherichia coli) genetic backgrounds we provide evidence that (i) lasR is expressed constitutively throughout the growth cycle, (ii) rhlR expression is regulated by LasR/OdDHL, and (iii) that RhlR/BHL regulates rhll. We also show that expression of the stationary-phase sigma factor gene rpoS is abolished in a P. aeruginosa lasR mutant and in the pleiotropic BHL-negative mutant PANO67. Furthermore, our data reveal that kin E. coli, an rpoS-lacZ fusion is regulated directly by RhlR/BHL. Taken together, these results indicate that P. aeruginosa employs a multilayered hierarchical quorum-sensing cascade involving RhlR/BHL and LasR/OdDHL, interlinked via RpoS, to integrate the regulation of virulence determinants and secondary metabolites with adaptation and survival in the stationary phase.},

   Abstract = {Three global regulators are known to control antibiotic production by Pseudomonas fluorescens. A two-component regulatory system comprised of the sensor kinase GacS (previously called ApdA or LemA) and GacA, a member of the FixJ family of response regulators, is required for antibiotic production. A mutation in rpoS, which encodes the stationary-phase sigma factor sigmaS, differentially affects antibiotic production and reduces the capacity of stationary-phase cells of P. fluorescens to survive exposure to oxidative stress. The gacA gene of P. fluorescens Pf-5 was isolated, and the influence of gacS and gacA on rpoS transcription, sigmaS levels, and oxidative stress response of Pf-5 was determined. We selected a gacA mutant of Pf-5 that contained a single nucleotide substitution within a predicted alpha-helical region, which is highly conserved among the FixJ family of response regulators. At the entrance to stationary phase, sigmaS content in gacS and gacA mutants of Pf-5 was less than 20% of the wild-type level. Transcription of rpoS, assessed with an rpoS-lacZ transcriptional fusion, was positively influenced by GacS and GacA, an effect that was most evident at the transition between exponential growth and stationary phase. Mutations in gacS and gacA compromised the capacity of stationary-phase cells of Pf-5 to survive exposure to oxidative stress. The results of this study provide evidence for the predominant roles of GacS and GacA in the regulatory cascade controlling stress response and antifungal metabolite production in P. fluorescens.},

The alternative sigma factor encoded by the rpoS gene is known to be important for survival under stressful conditions in several other bacterial species. To determine if the P. aeruginosa RpoS protein plays a similar role in stationary-phase-mediated resistance, an rpoS mutant was constructed and survival during exposure to hydrogen peroxide, high temperature, hyperosmolarity, low pH and ethanol was investigated. Disruption of the rpoS gene resulted in a two- to threefold increase in the rate of kill of stationary-phase cells. The rpoS mutant also survived less well than the parental strain during the initial phase of carbon or phosphate-carbon starvation. However, after 25 d starvation the remaining population of culturable cells was not significantly different. Stationary-phase cells of the RpoS-negative strain were much more stress resistant than exponentially growing RpoS-positive cells, suggesting that factors other than the RpoS protein must be associated with stationary-phase stress tolerance in P. aeruginosa. Comparison of two-dimensional PAGE of the rpoS mutant and the parental strain showed four major modifications of protein patterns associated with the rpoS mutation.},

   Abstract = {The sigma factor RpoS (sigmaS) has been described as a general stress response regulator that controls the expression of genes which confer increased resistance to various stresses in some gram-negative bacteria. To elucidate the role of RpoS in Pseudomonas aeruginosa physiology and pathogenesis, we constructed rpoS mutants in several strains of P. aeruginosa, including PAO1. The PAO1 rpoS mutant was subjected to various environmental stresses, and we compared the resistance phenotype of the mutant to that of the parent. The PAO1 rpoS mutant was slightly more sensitive to carbon starvation than the wild-type strain, but this phenotype was obvious only when the cells were grown in a medium supplemented with glucose as the sole carbon source. In addition, the PAO1 rpoS mutant was hypersensitive to heat shock at 50 degrees C, increased osmolarity, and prolonged exposure to high concentrations of H2O2. In accordance with the hypersensitivity to H2O2, catalase production was 60% lower in the rpoS mutant than in the parent strain. We also assessed the role of RpoS in the production of several exoproducts known to be important for virulence of P. aeruginosa. The rpoS mutant produced 50% less exotoxin A, but it produced only slightly smaller amounts of elastase and LasA protease than the parent strain. The levels of phospholipase C and casein-degrading proteases were unaffected by a mutation in rpoS in PAO1. The rpoS mutation resulted in the increased production of the phenazine antibiotic pyocyanin and the siderophore pyoverdine. This increased pyocyanin production may be responsible for the enhanced virulence of the PAO1 rpoS mutant that was observed in a rat chronic-lung-infection model. In addition, the rpoS mutant displayed an altered twitching-motility phenotype, suggesting that the colonization factors, type IV fimbriae, were affected. Finally, in an alginate-overproducing cystic fibrosis (CF) isolate, FRD1, the rpoS101::aacCI mutation almost completely abolished the production of alginate when the bacterium was grown in a liquid medium. On a solid medium, the FRD1 rpoS mutant produced approximately 70% less alginate than did the wild-type strain. Thus, our data indicate that although some of the functions of RpoS in P. aeruginosa physiology are similar to RpoS functions in other gram-negative bacteria, it also has some functions unique to this bacterium.},

   Abstract = {In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, many exoproduct virulence determinants are regulated via a hierarchical quorum-sensing cascade involving the transcriptional regulators LasR and RhlR and their cognate activators, N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (3O-C12-HSL) and N-butanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (C4-HSL). In this paper, we demonstrate that the cytotoxic lectins PA-IL and PA-IIL are regulated via quorum sensing. Using immunoblot analysis, the production of both lectins was found to be directly dependent on the rhl locus while, in a lasR mutant, the onset of lectin synthesis was delayed but not abolished. The PA-IL structural gene, lecA, was cloned and sequenced. Transcript analysis indicated a monocistronic organization with a transcriptional start site 70 bp upstream of the lecA translational start codon. A lux box-type element together with RpoS (sigma(S)) consensus sequences was identified upstream of the putative promoter region. In Escherichia coli, expression of a lecA::lux reporter fusion was activated by RhlR/C4-HSL, but not by LasR/3O-C12-HSL, confirming direct regulation by RhlR/C4-HSL. Similarly, in P. aeruginosa PAO1, the expression of a chromosomal lecA::lux fusion was enhanced but not advanced by the addition of exogenous C4-HSL but not 3O-C12-HSL. Furthermore, mutation of rpoS abolished lectin synthesis in P. aeruginosa, demonstrating that both RpoS and RhlR/C4-HSL are required. Although the C4-HSL-dependent expression of the lecA::lux reporter in E. coli could be inhibited by the presence of 3O-C12-HSL, this did not occur in P. aeruginosa. This suggests that, in the homologous genetic background, 3O-C12-HSL does not function as a posttranslational regulator of the RhlR/C4-HSL-dependent activation of lecA expression.},

Studies of lacZ transcription in these strains indicated that rpoS was not regulated by RhlR-RhlI. We also generated an rpoS null mutant.

   Abstract = {The rpoS gene encodes the sigma factor which was identified in several gram-negative bacteria as a central regulator during stationary phase. rpoS gene regulation is known to respond to cell density, showing higher expression in stationary phase. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, it has been demonstrated that the cell-density-dependent regulation response known as quorum sensing interacts with this regulatory response. Using the rpoS promoter of P. putida, we identified a genomic Tn5 insertion mutant of P. putida which showed a 90% decrease in rpoS promoter activity, resulting in less RpoS being present in a cell at stationary phase. Molecular analysis revealed that this mutant carried a Tn5 insertion in a gene, designated psrA (Pseudomonas sigma regulator), which codes for a protein (PsrA) of 26.3 kDa. PsrA contains a helix-turn-helix motif typical of DNA binding proteins and belongs to the TetR family of bacterial regulators. The homolog of the psrA gene was identified in P. aeruginosa; the protein showed 90% identity to PsrA of P. putida. A psrA::Tn5 insertion mutant of P. aeruginosa was constructed. In both Pseudomonas species, psrA was genetically linked to the SOS lexA repressor gene. Similar to what was observed for P. putida, a psrA null mutant of P. aeruginosa also showed a 90% reduction in rpoS promoter activity; both mutants could be complemented for rpoS promoter activity when the psrA gene was provided in trans. psrA mutants of both Pseudomonas species lost the ability to induce rpoS expression at stationary phase, but they retained the ability to produce quorum-sensing autoinducer molecules. PsrA was demonstrated to negatively regulate psrA gene expression in Pseudomonas and in Escherichia coli as well as to be capable of activating the rpoS promoter in E. coli. Our data suggest that PsrA is an important regulatory protein of Pseudomonas spp. involved in the regulatory cascade controlling rpoS gene regulation in response to cell density.},

   Abstract = {During nutrient starvation, Escherichia coli elicits a stringent response involving the ribosome-associated protein RelA. Activation of RelA results in a global change in the cellular metabolism including enhanced expression of the stationary-phase sigma factor RpoS. In the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a complex quorum-sensing circuitry, linked to RpoS expression, is required for cell density-dependent production of many secreted virulence factors, including LasB elastase. Quorum sensing relies on the activation of specific transcriptional regulators (LasR and RhlR) by their corresponding autoinducers (3-oxo-C(12)-homoserine lactone [HSL] and C(4)-HSL), which function as intercellular signals. We found that overexpression of relA activated the expression of rpoS in P. aeruginosa and led to premature, cell density-independent LasB elastase production. We therefore investigated the effects of the stringent response on quorum sensing. Both lasR and rhlR gene expression and autoinducer synthesis were prematurely activated during the stringent response induced by overexpression of relA. Premature expression of lasR and rhlR was also observed when relA was overexpressed in a PAO1 rpoS mutant. The stringent response induced by the amino acid analogue serine hydroxamate (SHX) also led to premature production of the 3-oxo-C(12)-HSL autoinducer. This response to SHX was absent in a PAO1 relA mutant. These findings suggest that the stringent response can activate the two quorum-sensing systems of P. aeruginosa independently of cell density.},

More recently, Hfq was shown to affect the stability of several E. coli mRNAs, including ompA mRNA, where it interferes with ribosome binding, which in turn results in rapid degradation of the transcript. In contrast, Hfq is also required for efficient translation of the E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium rpoS gene, encoding the stationary sigma factor. In this study, the authors have isolated and characterized the Hfq homologue of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Hfq(Pa)), which consists of only 82 aa. The 68 N-terminal amino acids of Hfq(Pa) show 92% identity with Hfq(Ec). Hfq(Pa) was shown to functionally replace Hfq(Ec) in terms of its requirement for phage Qbeta replication and for rpoS expression. In addition, Hfq(Pa) exerted the same negative effect on E. coli ompA mRNA expression. As judged by proteome analysis, the expression of either the plasmid-borne hfq(Pa) or the hfq(Ec) gene in an E. coli Hfq(-) RpoS(-) strain revealed no gross difference in the protein profile. Both Hfq(Ec) and Hfq(Pa) affected the synthesis of approximately 26 RpoS-independent E. coli gene products. These studies showed that the functional domain of Hfq resides within its N-terminal domain. The observation that a C-terminally truncated Hfq(Ec) lacking the last 27 aa [Hfq(Ec(75))] can also functionally replace the full-length E. coli protein lends further support to this notion.},

This protein was purified from P. fluorescens, and RNA bound to it was converted to cDNA, which served as a probe to isolate the corresponding chromosomal locus, rsmZ. This gene encoded a regulatory RNA of 127 nucleotides and a truncated form lacking 35 nucleotides at the 3' end. Expression of rsmZ depended on GacA, increased with increasing population density, and was stimulated by the addition of a solvent-extractable extracellular signal produced by strain CHA0 at the end of exponential growth. This signal appeared to be unrelated to N-acyl-homoserine lactones. A conserved upstream element in the rsmZ promoter, but not the stress sigma factor RpoS, was involved in rsmZ expression. Overexpression of rsmZ effectively suppressed the negative effect of gacS and gacA mutations on target genes, i.e., hcnA (for hydrogen cyanide synthase) and aprA (for the major exoprotease). Mutational inactivation of rsmZ resulted in reduced expression of these target genes in the presence of added signal. Overexpression of rsmA had a similar, albeit stronger negative effect. These results support a model in which GacA upregulates the expression of regulatory RNAs, such as RsmZ of strain CHA0, in response to a bacterial signal. By a titration effect, RsmZ may then alleviate the repressing activity of RsmA on the expression of target mRNAs.},

   Abstract = {The genes lemA (which we here redesignate gacS) and gacA encode members of a widely conserved two-component regulatory system. In Pseudomonas syringae strain B728a, gacS and gacA are required for lesion formation on bean, as well as for the production of protease and the toxin syringomycin. A gene, designated salA, was discovered that restored syringomycin production to a gacS mutant when present on a multiple-copy plasmid. Disruption of chromosomal salA resulted in loss of syringomycin production and lesion formation in laboratory assays. Sequence analysis of salA suggests that it encodes a protein with a DNA-binding motif but without other significant similarity to proteins in current databases. Chromosomal reporter fusions revealed that gacS and gacA positively regulate salA, that salA upregulates its own expression and that salA positively regulates the expression of a syringomycin biosynthetic gene, syrB. Loss of syringomycin production does not account for the salA mutant's attenuated pathogenicity, as a syrB mutant was found to retain full virulence. The salA gene did not similarly suppress the protease deficient phenotype of gacS mutants, nor were salA mutants affected for protease production. A gacS/gacA-dependent homoserine lactone activity as detected by bioassay was also unaffected by the disruption of salA. Thus, salA appears to encode a novel regulator that activates the expression of at least two separate genetic subsets of the gacS/gacA regulon, one pathway leading to syringomycin production and the other resulting in plant disease.},

   Abstract = {As part of its adaptive response to oxidative stress, Escherichia coli produces two inducible hydroperoxidases called HPI and HPII. Upon exposure to sublethal levels of hydrogen peroxide, HPI expression is induced at the transcriptional level by OxyR, a member of the LysR family of autoregulators. OxyR, functioning as both a sensor and transducer, contains a critical redox-sensitive Cys residue that is oxidized by hydrogen peroxide. This is thought to induce a conformational change in the tertiary structure of the OxyR tetramer altering its DNA-binding specificity and resulting in an increase in the transcription of katG and several other OxyR-dependent genes. In contrast, synthesis of the HPII enzyme is not induced by hydrogen peroxide. Expression of both HPI and HPII is growth phase-dependent levels of HPI and HPII are 10-fold higher in stationary phase than exponential phase cultures. These growth phase-dependent increases are largely dependent on RpoS, a stationary phase specific sigma factor that is itself subject to complex transcriptional and post-transcriptional controls. Several metabolic signals have been proposed to activate the RpoS regulon including hyperosmolarity, weak acids, homoserine lactone and UDP-glucose. Since both HPI and HPII are members of the RpoS regulon, elucidation of the mechanism of regulation of RpoS should contribute to our general understanding of hydroperoxidase regulation.},

All three mutants caused by nitrosoguanidine produced a protein with little or no catalase activity but with the same subunit molecular weight and with similar antigenic properties to HPI, implying the presence of missense mutations rather than nonsense mutations in each strain. Indeed one mutant produced an HPI-like protein that retained peroxidase activity, whereas the HPI-like protein in a second mutant exhibited no catalase or peroxidase activity. The third mutant responded to ascorbate induction with the synthesis of near normal catalase levels, suggesting a regulatory defect.

Multiple catalase activities were identified in both periplasmic and cytoplasmic fluids of exponential- and stationary-phase P. syringae cells. Two of these activities were unique to the periplasm of P. syringae pv. glycinea. During the stationary growth phase, the specific activity of cytoplasmic catalases increased four- to eightfold. The specific activities of catalases in both fluids from exponential-phase cells increased in response to treatment with 0.25 to 10 mM H2O2 but decreased when higher H2O2 concentrations were used. In stationary-growth phase cultures, the specific activities of cytoplasmic catalases increased remarkably after treatment with 0.25 to 50 mM H2O2. The growth of P. syringae into stationary phase and H2O2 treatment did not induce synthesis of additional catalase isozymes. Only the stationary-phase cultures of all of the P. syringae strains which we tested were capable of surviving high H2O2 stress at concentrations up to 50 mM. Our results are consistent with the involvement of multiple catalase isozymes in the reduction of oxidative stress during plant pathogenesis by these bacteria.},

Transcription of these genes was regulated in response to H(2)O(2), paraquat, or organic peroxides. Expression of katB-lacZ and the observed KatB catalase levels in P. aeruginosa PAO1 were induced up to 250-fold after exposure to oxidative stress-generating compounds. Also, ahpB-lacZ and ahpC-lacZ expression was 90- and 3-fold higher, respectively, upon exposure to paraquat. The dose- and time-response curves revealed that 1 microM paraquat was sufficient for half-maximal activation of each reporter fusion within 5 min of exposure. Expression of these genes was not observed in a DeltaoxyR mutant, indicating that OxyR was essential for this response. The transcriptional start sites of katB-ankB, ahpB, and ahpC-ahpF were mapped, putative OxyR-binding sites were identified upstream of the -35 promoter elements, and direct binding of purified OxyR protein to these target promoters was demonstrated. The oxyR mutant was hypersusceptible to oxidative stress-generating agents, including H(2)O(2) and paraquat, in spite of total KatA catalase activity being comparable to that of the wild type. The oxyR phenotype was fully complemented by a plasmid containing the oxyR gene, while any of the katB, ahpB, or ahpCF genes alone resulted in only marginal complementation. Increased katB-lacZ expression and higher KatB catalase levels were detected in a DeltaahpCF background compared to wild-type bacteria, suggesting a compensatory function for KatB in the absence of AhpCF. In P. aeruginosa, oxyR is located upstream of recG, encoding a putative DNA repair enzyme. oxyR-lacZ and recG-lacZ reporter activities and oxyR-recG mRNA analysis showed that oxyR and recG are organized in an operon and expressed constitutively with regard to oxidative stress from a single promoter upstream of oxyR. Mutants affected in recG but not oxyR were dramatically impaired in DNA damage repair as measured by sensitivity to UV irradiation. In conclusion, we present evidence that the oxyR-recG locus is essential for oxidative stress defense and for DNA repair.},

For maximal catalase activity, biofilm cells required significantly more iron (25 microM as FeCl(3)) in the medium, whereas planktonic cultures required no addition of iron. However, iron-stimulated catalase activity in biofilms was still only about one-third that in planktonic cells. Oxygen effects on catalase activity were also investigated. Nitrate-respiring planktonic cultures produced approximately twice as much catalase activity as aerobic cultures grown in the presence of nitrate; the nitrate stimulation effect could also be demonstrated in biofilms. Cultures fermenting arginine had reduced catalase levels; however, catalase repression was also observed in aerobic cultures grown in the presence of arginine. It was concluded that iron availability, but not oxygen availability, is a major factor affecting catalase expression in biofilms.},

   Abstract = {Operon OP2 on the Pseudomonas putida TOL plasmid encodes enzymes for m-toluate catabolism; transcription of this operon is activated by XylS in the presence of m-toluate. Because transcriptional activation of OP2 specifically occurs in the stationary phase of growth both in P. putida and in Escherichia coli, we suspected that its transcription is dependent on RpoS (sigmaS). Therefore, we constructed a rpoS disruption strain of P. putida mt-2, and assayed OP2 expression and other phenotypes. OP2 transcription was dependent on rpoS, indicating that the stationary-phase specific activation of OP2 is due to positive regulation by RpoS in P. putida mt-2. The rpoS mutant exhibited reduced viability during the stationary phase and was sensitive to high salt concentrations and H2O2. P. putida mt-2 has two catalase isozymes, KatA and KatB. Expression of the katB gene was specific to the stationary phase and entirely dependent on the rpoS gene, while the katA gene expressed during log phase partially required rpoS. There were no significant changes in tolerance to high temperature or UV light in the rpoS mutant. No difference was observed between the E. coli rpoS mutants and their parents in their capacity to activate OP2, suggesting that the mechanism of OP2 activation in the stationary phase of growth differs between P. putida and E. coli.},

These mutants express the growth advantage in stationary phase (GASP) phenotype.

Tormo, and R. Kolter, Science 259:1757-1760, 1993). Here we have identified three new GASP loci from an aged rpoS819 strain: sgaA, sgaB, and sgaC. Each locus is capable of conferring GASP on the rpoS819 parent, and they can provide successively higher fitnesses for the bacteria in the starved cultures. All four GASP mutations isolated thus far allow for faster growth on both individual and mixtures of amino acids. Each mutation confers a growth advantage on a different subset of amino acids, and these mutations act in concert to increase the overall catabolic capacity of the cell. We present a model whereby this enhanced ability to catabolize amino acids is responsible for the fitness gain during carbon starvation, as it may allow GASP mutants to outcompete the parental cells when growing on the amino acids released by dying cells.},

   Abstract = {Evolution by natural selection occurs in cultures of Escherichia coli maintained under carbon starvation stress. Mutants of increased fitness express a growth advantage in stationary phase (GASP) phenotype, enabling them to grow and displace the parent as the majority population. The first GASP mutation was identified as a loss-of-function allele of rpoS, encoding the stationary-phase global regulator, sigma(S) (M. M. Zambrano, D. A. Siegele, M. A. Almiron, A. Tormo, and R. Kolter, Science 259:1757-1760, 1993). We now report that a second global regulator, Lrp, can also play a role in stationary-phase competition. We found that a mutant that took over an aged culture of an rpoS strain had acquired a GASP mutation in lrp. This GASP allele, lrp-1141, encodes a mutant protein lacking the critical glycine in the turn of the helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain. The lrp-1141 allele behaves as a null mutation when in single copy and is dominant negative when overexpressed. Hence, the mutant protein appears to retain stability and the ability to dimerize but lacks DNA-binding activity. We also demonstrated that a lrp null allele generated by a transposon insertion has a fitness gain identical to that of the lrp-1141 allele, verifying that cells lacking Lrp activity have a competitive advantage during prolonged starvation. Finally, we tested by genetic analysis the hypothesis that the lrp-1141 GASP mutation confers a fitness gain by enhancing amino acid catabolism during carbon starvation. We found that while amino acid catabolism may play a role, it is not necessary for the lrp GASP phenotype, and hence the lrp GASP phenotype is due to more global physiological changes.},

   Abstract = {Starved cultures of Escherichia coli are highly dynamic, undergoing frequent population shifts. The shifts result from the spread of mutants able to grow under conditions that impose growth arrest on the ancestral population. To analyze competitive interactions underlying this dynamic we measured the survival of a typical mutant and the wild type during such population shifts. Here we show that the survival advantage of the mutant at any given time during a takeover is inversely dependent on its frequency in the population, its growth adversely affects the survival of the wild type, and its ability to survive in stationary phase at fixation is lower than that of its ancestor. These mutants do not enter, or exit early, the nondividing stationary-phase state, cooperatively maintained by the wild type. Thus they end up overrepresented as compared to their initial frequency at the onset of the stationary phase, and subsequently they increase disproportionately their contribution in terms of progeny to the succeeding generation in the next growth cycle, which is a case of evolutionary cheating. If analyzed through the game theory framework, these results might be explained by the prisoner's dilemma type of conflict, which predicts that selfish defection is favored over cooperation.},

   Abstract = {The general stress resistance of Escherichia coli is controlled by the RpoS sigma factor (varphi(S)), but mutations in rpoS are surprisingly common in natural and laboratory populations. Evidence for the selective advantage of losing rpoS was obtained from experiments with nutrient-limited bacteria at different growth rates. Wild-type bacteria were rapidly displaced by rpoS mutants in both glucose- and nitrogen-limited chemostat populations. Nutrient limitation led to selection and sweeps of rpoS null mutations and loss of general stress resistance. The rate of takeover by rpoS mutants was most rapid (within 10 generations of culture) in slower-growing populations that initially express higher varphi(S) levels. Competition for core RNA polymerase is the likeliest explanation for reduced expression from distinct promoters dependent on varphi(70) and involved in the hunger response to nutrient limitation. Indeed, the mutation of rpoS led to significantly higher expression of genes contributing to the high-affinity glucose scavenging system required for the hunger response. Hence, rpoS polymorphism in E. coli populations may be viewed as the result of competition between the hunger response, which requires sigma factors other than varphi(S) for expression, and the maintenance of the ability to withstand external stresses. The extent of external stress significantly influences the spread of rpoS mutations. When acid stress was simultaneously applied to glucose-limited cultures, both the phenotype and frequency of rpoS mutations were attenuated in line with the level of stress. The conflict between the hunger response and maintenance of stress resistance is a potential weakness in bacterial regulation.},

Using a combination of gene-fusion technology and quantitative immunoblot, pulse-labeling, and immunoprecipitation analyses, we demonstrate here that rpoS/sigma S expression is not only transcriptionally controlled, but is also extensively regulated at the levels of translation and protein stability. rpoS transcription is inversely correlated with growth rate and is negatively controlled by cAMP-CRP. In complex medium rpoS transcription is stimulated during entry into stationary phase, whereas in minimal media, it is not significantly induced. rpoS translation is stimulated during transition into stationary phase as well as by an increase in medium osmolarity. A model involving mRNA secondary structure is suggested for this novel type of post-transcriptional growth phase-dependent and osmotic regulation. Furthermore, sigma S is a highly unstable protein in exponentially growing cells (with a half-life of 1.4 min), that is stabilized at the onset of starvation. When cells are grown in minimal glucose medium, translational induction and sigma S stabilization occur in a temporal order with the former being stimulated already in late exponential phase and the latter taking place at the onset of starvation. Although sigma S does not control its own transcription, it is apparently indirectly involved in a negative feedback control that operates on the post-transcriptional level. Our analysis also indicates that at least five different signals [cAMP, a growth rate-related signal (ppGpp?), a cell density signal, an osmotic signal, and a starvation signal] are involved in the control of all these processes that regulate rpoS/sigma S expression.},

All expression of beta-galactosidase from the dsrB::lacZ fusion is also dependent on the stationary phase sigma factor, RpoS. DsrA RNA was found to regulate dsrB::lacZ indirectly, by modulating RpoS synthesis. Levels of RpoS protein are substantially lower in a dsrA mutant, both in stationary and exponential phase cells. Mutations in dsrA decrease the expression of an RpoS::LacZ translational fusion, but not a transcriptional fusion, suggesting that DsrA is acting after transcription initiation. While RpoS expression is very low in exponential phase at temperatures of 30 degrees C and above, at 20 degrees C there is substantial synthesis of RpoS during exponential growth, all dependent on DsrA RNA. dsrA expression is also increased at low temperatures. These results suggest a new role for RpoS during exponential growth at low temperatures, mediated by DsrA.},

These two activities of DsrA can be separated by mutation: the first of three stem-loops of the 85 nucleotide RNA is necessary for RpoS translation but not for anti-H-NS action, while the second stem-loop is essential for antisilencing and less critical for RpoS translation. The third stem-loop, which behaves as a transcription terminator, can be substituted by the trp transcription terminator without loss of either DsrA function. The sequence of the first stem-loop of DsrA is complementary with the upstream leader portion of rpoS messenger RNA, suggesting that pairing of DsrA with the rpoS message might be important for translational regulation. Mutations in the Rpos leader and compensating mutations in DsrA confirm that this predicted pairing is necessary for DsrA stimulation of RpoS translation. We propose that DsrA pairing stimulates RpoS translation by acting as an anti-antisense RNA, freeing the translation initiation region from the cis-acting antisense RNA and allowing increased translation.},

   Abstract = {The acid tolerance response (ATR) of log-phase Salmonella typhimurium is induced by acid exposures below pH 4.5 and will protect cells against more extreme acid. Two systems are evident: a transiently induced system dependent on the iron regulator Fur that provides a moderate degree of acid tolerance and a more effective sustained ATR that requires the alternate sigma factor sigma S encoded by rpoS. Differences between the acid responses of virulent S. typhimurium and the attenuated laboratory strain LT2 were attributed to disparate levels of RpoS caused by different translational starts. The sustained ATR includes seven newly identified acid shock proteins (ASPs) that are dependent upon sigma S for their synthesis. It is predicted that one or more of these ASPs is essential for the sustained system. The sustained ATR also provided cross-protection to a variety of other environmental stresses (heat, H2O2 and osmolarity); however, adaptation to the other stresses did not provide significant acid tolerance. Therefore, in addition to starvation, acid shock serves as an important signal for inducing general stress resistance. Consistent with this model, sigma S proved to be induced by acid shock. Our results also revealed a connection between the transient and sustained ATR systems. Mutations in the regulator atbR are known to cause the overproduction of ten proteins, of which one or more can suppress the acid tolerance defect of an rpoS mutant. One member of the AtbR regulon, designated atrB, was found to be co-regulated by sigma S and AtbR. Both regulators had a negative effect on atrB expression. The results suggest AtrB serves as a link between the sustained and transient ATR systems. When sigma S concentrations are low, a compensatory increase in AtrB is required to engage the transiently induced, RpoS-independent system of acid tolerance. Results also suggest different acid-sensitive targets occur in log-phase versus stationary-phase cells.},

   Abstract = {During carbon-starvation-induced entry into stationary phase, Escherichia coli cells exhibit a variety of physiological and morphological changes that ensure survival during periods of prolonged starvation. Induction of 30-50 proteins of mostly unknown function has been shown under these conditions. In an attempt to identify C-starvation-regulated genes we isolated and characterized chromosomal C-starvation-induced csi::lacZ fusions using the lambda placMu system. One operon fusion (csi2::lacZ) has been studied in detail. csi2::lacZ was induced during transition from exponential to stationary phase and was negatively regulated by cAMP. It was mapped at 59 min on the E. coli chromosome and conferred a pleiotropic phenotype. As demonstrated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, cells carrying csi2::lacZ did not synthesize at least 16 proteins present in an isogenic csi2+ strain. Cells containing csi2::lacZ or csi2::Tn10 did not produce glycogen, did not develop thermotolerance and H2O2 resistance, and did not induce a stationary-phase-specific acidic phosphatase (AppA) as well as another csi fusion (csi5::lacZ). Moreover, they died off much more rapidly than wild-type cells during prolonged starvation. We conclude that csi2::lacZ defines a regulatory gene of central importanc e for stationary phase E. coli cells. These results and the cloning of the wild-type gene corresponding to csi2 demonstrated that the csi2 locus is allelic with the previously identified regulatory genes katF and appR. The katF sequence indicated that its gene product is a novel sigma factor supposed to regulate expression of catalase HPII and exonuclease III (Mulvey and Loewen, 1989). We suggest that this novel sigma subunit of RNA polymerase defined by csi2/katF/appR is a central early regulator of a large starvation/stationary phase regulon in E. coli and propose 'rpoS' ('sigma S') as appropriate designations.},

Its synthesis is controlled transcriptionally and posttranscriptionally by as yet undefined mechanisms that are active well into stationary phase. sigma S controls a regulon of 30 or more genes expressed in response to starvation and during the transition to stationary phase. Proteins in the regulon, many of which have not been characterized, enhance long-term survival in nutrient-deficient medium and have a diverse group of functions including protection against DNA damage, the determination of morphological changes, the mediation of virulence, osmoprotection, and thermotolerance. Differential expression of subfamilies of genes within the regulon is effected by supplementary regulatory factors, working both individually and in combination to modulate activity of different sigma S-dependent promoters.},

   Abstract = {A mutation in the Escherichia coli gene encoding the stationary phase-inducible sigma factor (sigmaS, RpoS) not only abolishes transcription of some genes in stationary phase, but also causes superinduction of other stationary phase-induced genes. We have examined this phenomenon of repression by sigmaS using as a model system the divergently transcribed stationary phase-inducible genes, uspA and uspB. uspA is transcribed by sigma70-programmed RNA polymerase and is superinduced in an rpoS mutant, while uspB induction is sigmaS dependent. The data suggest that the superinduction of uspA is caused by an increased amount of sigma70 bound to RNA polymerase in the absence of the competing sigmaS. Increasing the ability of sigma70 to compete against sigmaS by overproducing sigma70 mimics the effect of an rpoS mutation by causing superinduction of sigma70-dependent stationary phase-inducible genes (uspA and fadD), silencing of sigmaS-dependent genes (uspB, bolAp1 and fadL) and inhibiting the development of sigmaS-dependent phenotypes, such as hydrogen peroxide resistance in stationary phase. In addition, overproduction of sigmaS markedly reduced stationary phase expression of a sigma70-dependent promoter. Thus, we conclude that sigma factors compete for a limiting amount of RNA polymerase during stationary phase. The implications of this competition in the passive control of promoter activity is discussed.},

Upon temperature upshift, the amount of sigma 32 transiently increases, resulting in the transient increase in transcription of the heat shock genes known as the heat shock response. Strains carrying the rpoH165 nonsense mutation and supC(Ts), a temperature-sensitive suppressor tRNA, do not exhibit a heat shock response. This defect is suppressed by rpoD800, a mutation in the gene encoding sigma 70. We have determined the mechanism of suppression. In contrast to wild-type strains, the level of sigma 32 and the level of transcription of heat shock genes remain relatively constant in an rpoH165 rpoD800 strain after a temperature upshift. Instead, the heat shock response in this strain results from an approximately fivefold decrease in the cellular transcription carried out by the RNA polymerase holoenzyme containing mutant RpoD800 sigma 70 coupled with an overall increase in the translational efficiency of all mRNA species.},

   Abstract = {The sigma(S) (RpoS) subunit of RNA polymerase is the master regulator of the general stress response in Escherichia coli and related bacteria. While rapidly growing cells contain very little sigma(S), exposure to many different stress conditions results in rapid and strong sigma(S) induction. Consequently, transcription of numerous sigma(S)-dependent genes is activated, many of which encode gene products with stress-protective functions. Multiple signal integration in the control of the cellular sigma(S) level is achieved by rpoS transcriptional and translational control as well as by regulated sigma(S) proteolysis, with various stress conditions differentially affecting these levels of sigma(S) control. Thus, a reduced growth rate results in increased rpoS transcription whereas high osmolarity, low temperature, acidic pH, and some late-log-phase signals stimulate the translation of already present rpoS mRNA. In addition, carbon starvation, high osmolarity, acidic pH, and high temperature result in stabilization of sigma(S), which, under nonstress conditions, is degraded with a half-life of one to several minutes. Important cis-regulatory determinants as well as trans-acting regulatory factors involved at all levels of sigma(S) regulation have been identified. rpoS translation is controlled by several proteins (Hfq and HU) and small regulatory RNAs that probably affect the secondary structure of rpoS mRNA. For sigma(S) proteolysis, the response regulator RssB is essential. RssB is a specific direct sigma(S) recognition factor, whose affinity for sigma(S) is modulated by phosphorylation of its receiver domain. RssB delivers sigma(S) to the ClpXP protease, where sigma(S) is unfolded and completely degraded. This review summarizes our current knowledge about the molecular functions and interactions of these components and tries to establish a framework for further research on the mode of multiple signal input into this complex regulatory system.},

   Abstract = {Temperature downshifts of Escherichia coli throughout its growth range resulted in transient growth inhibition and a cold shock response consisting of transient induction of several proteins, repression of heat shock proteins, and, despite the growth lag, continued synthesis of proteins involved in transcription and translation. The paradoxical synthesis of the latter proteins, which are normally repressed when growth is arrested, was explored further. First, by means of a nutritional downshift, a natural stringent response was induced in wild-type cells immediately prior to a shift from 37 to 10 degrees C. These cells displayed decreased synthesis of transcriptional and translational proteins and decreased induction of cold shock proteins; also, adaptation for growth at 10 degrees C was delayed, even after restoration of the nutrient supplementation. Next, the contribution of guanosine 5'-triphosphate-3'-diphosphate and guanosine 5'-diphosphate-3'-diphosphate, collectively abbreviated (p)ppGpp, to the alteration in cold shock response was studied with the aid of a mutant strain in which overproduction of these nucleotides can be artificially induced. Induction of (p)ppGpp synthesis immediately prior to shifting this strain from 37 to 10 degrees C produced results differing only in a few details from those described above for nutritional downshift of the wild-type strain. Finally, shifting a relA spoT mutant, which cannot synthesize (p)ppGpp, from 24 to 10 degrees C resulted in a greater induction of the cold shock proteins, increased synthesis of transcriptional and translational proteins, decreased synthesis of a major heat shock protein, and faster adaptation to growth than for the wild-type strain. Our results indicate that the previously reported decrease in the (p)ppGpp level following temperature downshift plays a physiological role in the regulation of gene expression and adaptation for growth at low temperature.},

An in vitro transcription/competition assay with reconstituted RNA polymerase showed that addition of ppGpp reduces the ability of wild-type sigma(70) to compete with sigma(32) for core binding and the mutant sigma(70) proteins, encoded by rpoD40 and rpoD35, compete less efficiently than wild-type sigma(70). Similarly, an in vivo competition assay showed that the ability of both sigma(32) and sigma(S) to compete with sigma(70) is diminished in cells lacking ppGpp. Consistently, the fraction of sigma(S) and sigma(32) bound to core was drastically reduced in ppGpp-deficient cells. Thus, the stringent response encompasses a mechanism that alters the relative competitiveness of sigma factors in accordance with cellular demands during physiological stress.},

Primer extension analysis of rsd mRNA indicated the presence of two promoters, sigmaS-dependent P1 and sigma70-dependent P2 with the gearbox sequence. To get insight into the in vivo role of Rsd, the expression of a reporter gene fused to either the sigma70- or sigmaS-dependent promoter was analyzed in the absence of Rsd or the presence of overexpressed Rsd. In the rsd null mutant, the sigma70- and sigmaS-dependent gene expression was increased or decreased, respectively. On the other hand, the sigma70- or sigmaS-dependent transcription was reduced or enhanced, respectively, after overexpression of Rsd. The repression of the sigmaS-dependent transcription in the rsd mutant is overcome by increased production of the sigmaS subunit. Together these observations support the prediction that Rsd is involved in replacement of the RNA polymerase sigma subunit from sigma70 to sigmaS during the transition from exponential growth to the stationary phase.},

   Abstract = {Strains of Escherichia coli which lack detectable guanosine 3',5'-bispyrophosphate (ppGpp) display a pleiotropic phenotype that in some respects resembles that of rpoS (katF) mutants. This led us to examine whether ppGpp is a positive regulator of sigma s synthesis. sigma s is a stationary-phase-specific sigma factor that is encoded by the rpoS gene. We found that a ppGpp-deficient strain is defective in sigma s synthesis as cells enter stationary phase in a rich medium, as judged by immunoblots. Under more-defined conditions we found that the stimulation of sigma s synthesis following glucose, phosphate, or amino acid starvation of wild-type strains is greatly reduced in a strain lacking ppGpp. The failure of ppGpp-deficient strains to synthesize sigma s in response to these starvation regimens could indicate a general defect in gene expression rather than a specific dependence of rpoS expression on ppGpp. We therefore tested the effect of artificially elevated ppGpp levels on sigma s synthesis either with mutations that impair ppGpp decay or by gratuitously inducing ppGpp synthesis with a Ptac::relA fusion. In both instances, we observed enhanced sigma s synthesis. Apparently, ppGpp can activate sigma s synthesis under conditions of nutrient sufficiency as well as during entry into stationary phase. This finding suggests that changes in ppGpp levels function both as a signal of imminent stationary phase and as a signal of perturbations in steady-state growth.},

   Abstract = {Salmonella typhimurium encounters a variety of acid stress situations during growth in host and nonhost environments. The organism can survive potentially lethal acid conditions (pH &lt;4) if it is first able to adapt to mild or more moderate acid levels. The molecular events that occur during this adaptive process are collectively referred to as the acid tolerance response and vary depending on whether the cells are in log- or stationary-phase growth. The acid tolerance response of logarithmically growing cells includes the participation of an alternate sigma factor, sigmaS (RpoS), commonly associated with stationary-phase physiology. Of 51 acid shock proteins (ASPs) induced during shifts to pH 4.4, 8 are clearly dependent on sigmaS for production (I. S. Lee, J. Lin, H. K. Hall, B. Bearson, and J. W. Foster, Mol. Microbiol. 17:155-167, 1995). The acid shock induction of these proteins appears to be the result of an acid shock-induced increase in the level of sigmaS itself. We have discovered that one component of a potential signal transduction system responsible for inducing rpoS expression is the product of the mouse virulence gene mviA+. MviA exhibits extensive homology to the regulatory components of certain two-component signal transduction systems (W. H. Benjamin, Jr., and P. D. Hall, abstr. B-67, p. 38, in Abstracts of the 93rd General Meeting of the American Society for Microbiology 1993, 1993). Mutations in mviA (mviA::Km) caused the overproduction of sigmaS and sigmaS-dependent ASPs in logarithmically growing cells, as well as increases in tolerances to acid, heat, osmolarity and oxidative stresses and significant decreases in growth rate and colony size. Mutations in rpoS suppressed the mviA::Km-associated defects in growth rate, colony size, ASP production, and stress tolerance, suggesting that the effects of MviA on cell physiology occur via its control of sigmaS levels. Western blot (immunoblot) analyses of sigmaS produced from natural or arabinose-regulated promoters revealed that acid shock and MviA posttranscriptionally regulate sigmaS levels. Turnover experiments suggest that MviA regulates the stability of sigmaS protein rather than the translation of rpoS message. We propose a model in which MviA or its unknown signal transduction partner senses some consequence of acid shock, and probably other stresses, and signals the release of sigmaS from proteolysis. The increased concentration of sigmaS drives the elevated expression of the sigmaS-dependent ASPs, resulting in an increase in stress tolerance. The avirulent nature of mviA insertion mutants, therefore, appears to result from inappropriate sigmaS-dependent gene expression during pathogenesis.},

Cells growing at high osmolarity already exhibit increased levels of sigma(s) during the exponential phase of growth. Osmotic induction of rpoS can be triggered by addition of NaCl or sucrose and is alleviated by glycine betaine. Stimulation of rpoS translation and a change in the half-life of sigma(s) from 3 to 50 min both contribute to osmotic induction. Experiments with lacZ fusions inserted at different positions within the rpoS gene indicate that an element required for sigma(s) degradation is encoded between nucleotides 379 and 742 of the rpoS coding sequence.},

Here we demonstrate that sigmaS is also induced by heat shock and that this induction is exclusively due to an interference with sigmaS turnover. Some sigmaS-dependent genes exhibit similar heat shock induction, whereas others are not induced probably because they need additional regulatory factors that might not be present under conditions of heat shock or exponential growth. Despite its induction, sigmaS does not seem to contribute to heat adaptation but may induce cross-protection against different stresses. While sigmaS is not involved in the regulation of the heat shock sigma factor sigma32, the heat shock protein DnaK has a positive role in the posttranscriptional control of sigmaS. The present evidence suggests that DnaK is involved in the transduction of two of the signals that result in reduced sigmaS turnover, i.e., heat shock and carbon starvation. Heat shock induction of sigmaS also clearly indicates that a cessation of growth or even a reduction of the growth rate is not a prerequisite for the induction of sigmaS and sigmaS-dependent genes and underscores the importance of sigmaS as a general stress sigma factor.},

Analysis of the DNA sequence reveals an open reading frame potentially encoding a polypeptide of 379 amino acids. The polypeptide sequence includes a consensus bacterial lipidation sequence present at residues 23 to 26 (Leu-Ala-Gly-Cys), four octapeptide proline- and glutamine-rich repeats of consensus sequence QQPQIQPV, and four heptapeptide threonine- and serine-rich repeats of consensus sequence PTA(S,T)TTE. The deduced amino acid sequence, especially in the C-terminal region, is similar to that of the Haemophilus somnus LppB lipoprotein outer membrane antigen (40% overall sequence identity; 77% identity in last 95 residues). The LppB lipoprotein binds Congo red dye and has been proposed to be a virulence determinant in H. somnus. Utilizing a plasmid construct with the E. coli gene under the control of a phage T7 promoter, we demonstrate the lipidation of this gene product by the incorporation of [3H]palmitic acid into a 42-kDa polypeptide. We also show that treatment of E. coli cells with globomycin, an inhibitor of the lipoprotein signal peptidase, results in the accumulation of a 46-kDa precursor. We thus designate the protein NlpD (new lipoprotein D). E. coli cells overexpressing NlpD bind Congo red dye, suggesting a common function with the H. somnus LppB protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Upstream of rpoS is an open reading frame (ORF) whose function and regulation have not been studied. Strong overproduction of its gene product using the IPTG-inducible tac promoter leads to the formation of bulges at the cell septum and the cell poles, and in rapidly growing cells brings about cell lysis, indicating that the gene product has a hydrolytic function in cell wall formation or maintenance. This is corroborated by sequence homology to lysostaphin, a cell wall lytic exoenzyme synthesized by two Staphylococcus strains. Using globomycin, a specific inhibitor of signal peptidase II, we demonstrate that the product of the ORF is a novel lipoprotein (NlpD). Two transcriptional start sites for nlpD have been localized. In contrast to rpoS, nlpD is not induced during entry into stationary phase. Growth-phase-regulated transcription of rpoS is initiated at additional sites within the nlpD ORF, but the nlpD promoters contribute substantially to the basal level of rpoS expression in exponentially growing cells, indicating that nlpD and rpoS form an operon.},

   Abstract = {mutS mutators accelerate the bacterial mutation rate 100- to 1,000-fold and relax the barriers that normally restrict homeologous recombination. These mutators thus afford the opportunity for horizontal exchange of DNA between disparate strains. While much is known regarding the mutS phenotype, the evolutionary structure of the mutS(+) gene in Escherichia coli remains unclear. The physical proximity of mutS to an adjacent polymorphic region of the chromosome suggests that this gene itself may be subject to horizontal transfer and recombination events. To test this notion, a phylogenetic approach was employed that compared gene phylogeny to strain phylogeny, making it possible to identify E. coli strains in which mutS alleles have recombined. Comparison of mutS phylogeny against predicted E. coli &quot;whole-chromosome&quot; phylogenies (derived from multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and mdh sequences) revealed striking levels of phylogenetic discordance among mutS alleles and their respective strains. We interpret these incongruences as signatures of horizontal exchange among mutS alleles. Examination of additional sites surrounding mutS also revealed incongruous distributions compared to E. coli strain phylogeny. This suggests that other regional sequences are equally subject to horizontal transfer, supporting the hypothesis that the 61.5-min mutS-rpoS region is a recombinational hot spot within the E. coli chromosome. Furthermore, these data are consistent with a mechanism for stabilizing adaptive changes promoted by mutS mutators through rescue of defective mutS alleles with wild-type sequences.},

   Abstract = {The induction of stress proteins is an important component of the adaptional network of a non-growing cell of Bacillus subtilis. A diverse range of stresses such as heat shock, salt stress, ethanol, starvation for oxygen or nutrients etc. induce the same set of proteins, called general stress proteins. Although the adaptive functions of these proteins are largely unknown, they are proposed to provide general and rather non-specific protection of the cell under these adverse conditions. In addition to these non-specific general stress proteins, all extracellular signals induce a set of specific stress proteins that may confer specific protection against a particular stress factor. In B. subtilis at least three different classes of heat-inducible genes can be defined by their common regulatory characteristics: Class I genes, as exemplified by the dnaK and groE operons, are most efficiently induced by heat stress. Their expression involves a sigma A-dependent promoter, an inverted repeat (called the CIRCE element) highly conserved among eubacteria, and probably a repressor interacting with the CIRCE element. The majority of general stress genes (class II, more than 40) are induced at sigma B-dependent promoters by different growth-inhibiting conditions. The activation of sigma B by stress or starvation is the crucial event in the induction of this large stress regulon. Only a few genes, including Ion, clpC, clpP, and ftsH, can respond to different stress factors independently of sigma B or CIRCE (class III). Stress induction of these genes occurs at promoters presumably recognized by sigma A and probably involves additional regulatory elements which remain to be defined.},

Conversion to mucoidy and a subsequent loss of mucoid character can occur via different mutations in the algU mucA mucB gene cluster. The algU gene encodes a 22.2-kDa putative alternative sigma factor required for expression of the critical alginate biosynthetic gene algD. In this work, algU transcription was studied by S1 nuclease protection analysis. Transcription from the promoter proximal to the algU coding region was found to be dependent on AlgU. The -35 and -10 sequences of this newly mapped promoter showed strong similarity ot the promoters of two other critical alg genes: algD and algR. The proximal promoter of algR was also shown to depend on algU. Interestingly, the putative -35 and -10 regions of all three promoters displayed striking similarity to the consensus sequence of the sigma E-dependent promoters in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. This 24-kDa sigma factor, controlling genes participating in resistance to high temperatures and oxidative stress, has been previously biochemically characterized, but the gene for sigma E remained unidentified. To examine whether AlgU is related to sigma E, the effect of algU inactivation on the sensitivity of P. aeruginosa to killing by heat and reactive oxygen intermediates was tested. Two isogenic pairs of algU+ and algU mutant strains were compared. The algU mutants, irrespective of the mucoid status of the parental strains, displayed increased sensitivity to killing by paraquat, known to generate intracellular superoxide radicals, and heat.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

We have identified the gene encoding sigma E using a genetic screen designed to isolate trans-acting mutations that abolish expression from either htrA or rpoHP3, two promoters recognized uniquely by sigma E-containing RNA polymerase. Such a screen was achieved by transducing strains carrying a single copy of either phtrA-lacZ or rpoHP3-lacZ fusions with mutagenized bacteriophage P1 lysates and screening for Lac- mutant colonies at 22 degrees C. Lac- mutants were subsequently tested for inability to grow at 43 degrees C (Ts- phenotype). Only those Lac- Ts- mutants that were unable to accumulate heat shock proteins at 50 degrees C were retained for further characterization. In a complementary approach, those genes which when cloned on a multicopy plasmid led to higher constitutive expression of the sigma E regulon were characterized and mapped. Both approaches identified the same gene, rpoE, mapping at 55.5 min on the E.coli genetic map and encoding a polypeptide of 191 amino acid residues. The wild-type and a mutant rpoE gene products were over-expressed and purified. It was found that the purified wild-type sigma E protein, when used in in vitro run-off transcription assays in combination with core RNA polymerase, was able to direct transcription from the htrA and rpoHP3 promoters, but not from known sigma 70-dependent promoters. In vivo and in vitro analyses of rpoE transcriptional regulation showed that the rpoE gene is transcribed from two major promoters, one of which is positively regulated by sigma E itself.},

   Abstract = {In Escherichia coli, the heat shock response is under the control of two alternative sigma factors: sigma 32 and sigma E. The sigma 32-regulated response is well understood, whereas little is known about that of sigma E, except that it responds to extracytoplasmic immature outer membrane proteins. To further understand this response, we located the rpoE gene at 55.5' and analyzed the role of sigma E. sigma E is required at high temperature, and controls the transcription of at least 10 genes. Some of these might contribute to the integrity of the cell since delta rpoE cells are more sensitive to SDS plus EDTA and crystal violet. sigma E controls its own transcription from a sigma E-dependent promoter, indicating that rpoE transcription plays a role in the regulation of E sigma E activity. Indeed, under steady-state conditions, the transcription from this promoter mirrors the levels of E sigma E activity in the cell. However, it is unlikely that the rapid increase in E sigma E activity following induction can be accounted for solely by increased transcription of rpoE. Based upon homology arguments, we suggest that a gene encoding a negative regulator of sigma E activity is located immediately downstream of rpoE and may function as the target of the E sigma E inducing signal.},

A clear exception is the sigma factor sigma 54 (sigma N), encoded by rpoN, which represents a second family of sigmas that is widely distributed in prokaryotes. Studies of sigma 54 (sigma N) have demonstrated that this sigma is quite distinct both structurally and functionally from the sigma 70 family and the mode of transcription initiation which it mediates may have more in common with that found in eukaryotes than that which occurs with sigma 70 and its relatives.},

At 6.3 million base pairs, this is the largest bacterial genome sequenced, and the sequence provides insights into the basis of the versatility and intrinsic drug resistance of P. aeruginosa. Consistent with its larger genome size and environmental adaptability, P. aeruginosa contains the highest proportion of regulatory genes observed for a bacterial genome and a large number of genes involved in the catabolism, transport and efflux of organic compounds as well as four potential chemotaxis systems. We propose that the size and complexity of the P. aeruginosa genome reflect an evolutionary adaptation permitting it to thrive in diverse environments and resist the effects of a variety of antimicrobial substances.},

This work describes a heavily modified version of MolScript that has added syntax for describing complicated coloring schemes and also has new graphics commands. Enhancements include drawing split-bond ball-and-stick models, smoothly varying the color of molecules (color ramping), abrupt color changes within secondary structural units, and the creation of dashed bonds. Making use of these added features is simple because all MolScript syntax is still supported and one typically needs only to add a few control commands. The final section of this article suggests some uses for this modified MolScript and provides illustrative examples.},

The reader will have noted that the information available is very incomplete, and that, in some cases, related experiments seem to lead to contradictory conclusions. We have tried to point out these discrepancies as they occur and to indicate areas where more experimentation is needed. We look forward to the day when all the microscopic steps of the single-nucleotide addition cycle can be identified and defined in thermodynamic, kinetic, and structural terms. At that point, we can begin to understand the principles that relate these parameters to template position and to the pathway of formation of a specific complex. It should be possible to provide specific molecular interpretations for observed effects on activation barrier heights to elongation and termination (154, 155) and to begin to understand the molecular bases of the regulation in these phases of transcription. Much work remains before this happy situation can be totally realized, but we feel that now the problem can at least be approached at this level. We hope that this review helps to illuminate the difficulties that remain.},

All sequence-specific contacts with core promoter elements are mediated by the sigma subunit. A universally conserved tryptophan is ideally positioned to stack on the exposed face of the base pair at the upstream edge of the transcription bubble. Universally conserved basic residues of the sigma subunit provide critical contacts with the DNA phosphate backbone and play a role in directing the melted DNA template strand into the RNA polymerase active site.

Important structural features of the RNA polymerase and their roles in positioning sigma within the initiation complex are delineated, as well as the role played by sigma in modulating the opening of the RNA polymerase active-site channel. The two carboxyl-terminal domains of sigma are separated by 45 angstroms on the surface of the RNA polymerase, but are linked by an extended loop. The loop winds near the RNA polymerase active site, where it may play a role in initiating nucleotide substrate binding, and out through the RNA exit channel. The advancing RNA transcript must displace the loop, leading to abortive initiation and ultimately to sigma release.},

The results define the second non-essential domain in the beta subunit, in addition to the more distal dispensable segment identified previously. The Alc protein of bacteriophage T4 participates in the host transcription shutoff after infection by causing premature termination of transcription on E. coli DNA. Point mutations which prevent Alc action in vivo change amino acids in the non-essential NH2-terminal domain of the beta subunit. These point mutations as well as deletions which remove the non-essential region also prevent Alc action. Thus, in the RNA polymerase molecule, the proximal non-essential domain of beta may function as an acceptor of Alc or other regulatory factors.},

We previously reported the cloning and sequencing of the gene encoding omega, which we call rpoZ (D. R. Gentry and R. R. Burgess, Gene 48:33-40, 1986). We constructed an rpoZ insertion mutation by placing a kanamycin resistance cassette into the coding region of the rpoZ gene. Purified RNA polymerase from strains carrying this mutation lacked detectable omega. We found that the insertion mutation conferred a slow-growth phenotype when introduced into most strains. We mapped the position of rpoZ on the E. coli chromosome by genetic techniques and by examining the restriction map of the whole chromosome and found that rpoZ maps around 82 min, very close to spoT. We determined that the slow-growth phenotype of the insertion mutant is suppressed in relA mutants and that the rpoZ insertion results in a classical SpoT- phenotype. This finding strongly suggests that rpoZ is upstream of spoT in the same operon and that the slow-growth phenotype elicited by the insertion mutation is due to polarity on spoT.},

The omega-less RNA polymerase from omega-less strains recruits the chaperonin, GroEL (unlike the wild-type enzyme), suggesting a structural deformity of the mutant enzyme. The GroEL-containing core RNA polymerase interacts efficiently with sigma70 to generate the fully functional holoenzyme. However, when GroEL was removed, the enzyme was irreversibly nonfunctional and was unable to bind to sigma70. The damaged enzyme regained activity after going through a cycle of denaturation and reconstitution in the presence of omega or GroEL. GroES was found to have an inhibitory effect on the core-sigma70 association unlike the omega subunit. The omega subunit may therefore be needed for stabilization of the structure of RNA polymerase.},

Genetic studies have indicated that sigma itself interacts with DNA at the -10 and -35 promoter consensus sequences. Binding of Escherichia coli sigma 70 to DNA in vitro, however, can only be observed for truncated polypeptides lacking the amino-terminal amino acids. We have investigated the role of the amino terminus of E. coli sigma 70 in controlling DNA-binding ability. Deletion analysis indicates that amino acids within amino-terminal region 1.1 of sigma 70 inhibit DNA binding by the carboxy-terminal DNA-binding domains. Furthermore, inhibition of binding by the amino-terminal inhibitory domain of sigma 70 can be observed in trans. Likewise, the amino-terminal extensions of two alternative sigma-factors, E. coli sigma 32 and Bacillus subtilis sigma K, negatively affect the DNA binding activity of their carboxy-terminal domains. We propose that initiation of transcription is subject to modulation as a result of the composition and/or structure of the amino terminus of the sigma-subunit and that the sigma family of proteins belong to a larger class of intramolecularly regulated transcriptional effectors.},

Direct binding of one of these regions to core can be demonstrated using a peptide-based approach. The same regions, and even equivalent residues, in sigma(32) and sigma(70) alter core interaction, suggesting that sigma(70) family members use homologous residues, at least in part, to interact with core. Finally, the regions of sigma that we identify perform specialized functions, suggesting that different portions of the interface perform discrete roles during transcription initiation.},

Previously, our laboratory defined a region of the beta' subunit that interacts with final sigma(70) in vitro. This region of beta' contained heptad repeat motifs indicative of coiled coils. In this work, we used 10 single point mutations of the predicted coiled coils, located within residues 260-309 of beta', to look at disruption of the final sigma(70)-core interaction. Several of the mutants were defective for binding final sigma(70) in vitro. Of these mutants, three (R275Q, E295K, and A302D) caused cells to be inviable in an in vivo assay in which the mutant beta' is the sole source of beta' subunit for the cell. All of the mutants were able to assemble into the core enzyme; however, R275Q, E295K, A302D were defective for Efinal sigma(70) holoenzyme formation. Several of the mutants were also defective for holoenzyme assembly with various minor final sigma factors.

Modeling of our mutations onto that coiled coil places the most defective mutations on one face of the coiled coil.},

We have investigated the function of the most highly conserved region, 2.2, using purified products of various rpoH alleles. Core RNAP binding analysis by glycerol gradient sedimentation has revealed reduced core RNAP affinity for one of the mutant sigma32 proteins, Q80R. This reduced core interaction is exacerbated in the presence of sigma70, which competes with sigma32 for binding of core RNAP. When a different but more conserved amino acid was introduced at this position by site-directed mutagenesis (Q80N), this mutant sigma factor still displayed a significant reduction in its core RNAP affinity. Based on these results, we conclude that at least one specific amino acid in region 2.2 is involved in core RNAP interaction.},

Selective binding to the nontemplate strand of the -10 region of the promoter is central to this process.

The spoIIG operon encodes sporulation-specific factor sigma E, and its transcription is directed from a promoter that is activated about 1 hr after the onset of endospore formation. This promoter contains sequences that are similar to those found at the -10 and -35 regions of promoters that are used by sigma A-associated RNA polymerase, but these sigma A-like recognition sequences are separated by 22 base pairs rather than the typical 17 or 18 base pairs. We have found that substitution of an arginyl residue for the glutamyl residue at position 196 of sigma A (Glu-196----Arg) suppresses the deleterious effect of a thymidine-to-cytidine base substitution at position -11 in the spoIIG promoter. This suppression was allele-specific, since it did not suppress the effects of base substitutions in other positions in the spoIIG promoter or the effects of a thymidine-to-guanosine change at -11. These results support a model in which a form of RNA polymerase containing sigma A is utilized in an unusual manner to activate the transcription of the spoIIG operon well after the onset of endospore formation.},

Earlier genetic studies implicated Thr-100 in region 2.4 of the Bacillus subtilis sigma factor sigma H in the recognition of the G.C base pair at position -13 in the -10 region (GAAT) of a cognate promoter. In confirmation of this assignment, we now show that a change-of-specificity mutant of sigma H in which Thr-100 was replaced with isoleucine suppresses a G.C----A.T nucleotide substitution at position -13 but not other "promoter down mutations" (causing impaired promoter activity) at positions -13, -12, and -11. We also show that a loss-of-contact mutant created by the replacement of Thr-100 with alanine (having a short side chain) enables sigma H to tolerate three different promoter down mutations at position -13 but not down mutations at other positions. Finally, we suggest the identification of an additional amino acid involved in base-pair recognition by the demonstration that the replacement of Arg-96 with alanine specifically suppresses an A.T----G.C promoter down mutation at position -12. The identification of amino acids that are four residues apart that are involved in the recognition of adjacent base pairs may fix the orientation of region 2.4 (its NH2 terminus being proximal to the promoter transcription start site) and is consistent with a model in which the recognition of promoter region -10 nucleotide sequences is mediated by an alpha-helix in which residues involved in base-pair contact are separated by one turn and clustered on one face of the helix.},

By studying the effects of alanine substitutions, we have investigated the role of the aromatic amino residues in the Escherichia coli sigma(70) conserved region 2.3 in promoter strand separation. The resulting mutants were assessed for their activity in vivo in the context of a sigma(70)/sigma(32) hybrid sigma factor that could be targeted to a specific hybrid promoter in the cell. All substitutions lead to an at least twofold reduction in expression of the hybrid promoter-driven reporter gene. The in vitro assay of single substitutions indicated cold sensitivity similar to that previously observed with analogous substitutions in Bacillus subtilis sigma(A). Kinetic assays showed that these substitutions slowed the rate of open complex formation at 37 degrees C as well. RNA polymerase reconstituted with a sigma(70) containing multiple alanine substitutions readily binds to promoter DNA, but then proceeds slowly beyond the first intermediate complex on the pathway to formation of the transcription-competent complex. These data demonstrate that together the aromatic residues in region 2.3 of E. coli sigma(70) ensure that DNA strand separation proceeds efficiently, even if no individual residue may be essential for accomplishment of the process.},

These were assayed for duplex DNA binding, DNA opening and DNA double strand-single strand fork junction binding. Band shift assays for closed complex formation implicated a series of arginine and aromatic residues within a minimal 26 amino acid region. Permanganate assays implicated two additional aromatic residues in DNA opening, known to form a parallel stack of the type that can accept a flipped-out base. Substitution for either of these aromatics had no effect on duplex probe recognition. However, when a single unpaired -11 nucleotide is added to the probe, the mutants fail to bind appropriately to give heparin resistance. A model for DNA opening is presented in which duplex recognition by regions 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 of sigma positions the pair of aromatic amino acids, which then create the fork junction required for stable opening.},

There is little or no effect on the activities of the wild-type and 23 other mutant ant promoters, including one with T.A at -33.

The corresponding change in sigma 70 is Arg588----His. This residue is in a region that is conserved among most sigma factors, a region that is also homologous with the helix-turn-helix motif of DNA-binding proteins.

   Abstract = {High-resolution gel electrophoresis has been used to detect and quantitate promoter-specific oligonucleotides produced during initiation of transcription in vitro at the lactose operon (lac) UV5 promoter. The resolved products are RNA species of various lengths which correspond to the initial lac mRNA sequence. Quantitation shows that many oligonucleotides can be formed per preinitiation complex, including species as long as hexanucleotide. Synthesis occurs without dissociation of the enzyme, as evidenced by levels of synthesis in the presence of heparin, a selective inhibitor of free RNA polymerase. Thus, RNA polymerase cycles at this promoter in vitro producing oligonucleotides reiteratively. In general, the yield of oligonucleotides decreases when the total concentration of all four substrates is increased or when a missing nucleoside triphosphate substrate is added. Nevertheless, oligonucleotide synthesis persists under all conditions tested. Strikingly, the dinucleotide always represents 50% of the total of all oligonucleotides, even when conditions are manipulated to cause a 100-fold variation in this total. This shows that, after formation of the first phosphodiester bond at the lac UV5 promoter, dissociation of the dinucleotide is as likely as formation of the second phosphodiester bond. As discussed above, after release of a small RNA, RNA polymerase may then begin another RNA chain, which is again subject to premature release. These considerations lead to a model in which RNA polymerase cycles to produce oligonucleotides during initiation of transcription at the lac UV5 promoter in vitro. Production of a long RNA transcript is then essentially an escape from this cycling reaction. The drug rifampicin, which drastically inhibits escape to produce RNA, limits, but dose not prevent, the cycling reaction.},

The most complete information about transcriptional mechanisms and their control continues to come from the Escherichia coli system, upon which most of the explicit descriptions provided here are based. The transcriptional machinery of higher organisms, despite its greater inherent complexity, appears to use many of the same general principles.

The relative amount of this population appears to depend on cellular growth and reaches its maximum during the stationary phase. The proportion of sigma(70)-retaining elongation complexes (EC-sigma(70)) is invariant with various promoters or distances from the transcription start site. EC-sigma(70) responds to pauses, intrinsic terminators, and the elongation factor NusA similarly to EC without sigma(70). However, EC-sigma(70) has a substantially higher ability to support multiple rounds of transcription at certain promoters, suggesting its profound role in gene expression and regulation in bacteria.},

In addition, we demonstrate that the expression of both transcriptional and translational rpoS::lacZ fusions as well as the level of rpoS mRNA originating at rpoSp1 is strongly reduced in ppGpp-deficient relA spoT mutants. However, experiments with the 5' deletion constructs indicate that a lack of ppGpp does affect transcriptional elongation rather than initiation.},

P1 and P2 transcription start sites were determined by primer extension analyses. The P2 promoter region shows similarity to the consensus sigma 70-type promoter sequence, and was recognized by both E sigma 70 and E sigma 38 holoenzymes in vitro. The mRNA transcribed from the most distal promoter, P1, appears to include another open reading frame (orf-281), indicating that the two open reading frames comprise an operon. The rpoS gene product (sigma 38) was rapidly degraded after addition of chloramphenicol to cultures in the exponential, but not the stationary phase. This strongly suggests that posttranslational regulation is involved in the control of rpoS expression.},

The expression of rpoS is regulated in a complex manner at the levels of transcription, translation, and stability of the product. Although a number of factors involved in the regulation of rpoS expression have been identified, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we identified the Crr (or EIIA(Glc)) protein as a novel factor that plays an important role not only in the transcriptional control but also in the translational control of rpoS expression. Crr is an important component in glucose uptake through the well-characterized phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system. The results of a series of genetic analyses revealed that Crr negatively controls rpoS translation and transcription. The observed transcriptional control by Crr appears to be mediated by cyclic AMP. However, it was found that Crr negatively controls rpoS translation rather directly. These results suggest a possible linkage between the control of rpoS expression and carbon metabolism.},

Stimulation of final sigma(28) synthesis was due to an increase in the level of cAMP, which occurred through polyamine stimulation of the synthesis of adenylate cyclase at the level of translation. Polyamines were found to increase the translation of adenylate cyclase mRNA by facilitating the UUG codon-dependent initiation.

   Abstract = {The stationary phase expression of many conserved, adaptive bacterial proteins is dependent on RpoS, a second vegetative sigma factor. The regulation of RpoS itself, however, is complex and not fully understood, particularly at the level of transcription. In this report, we show that the observed hydrogen peroxide sensitivity of a mutant defective in expression of barA, a bacterial virulence factor, can be explained by a reduction in catalase activity, an RpoS-controlled function. Levels of katE mRNA, encoding the major catalase of Escherichia coli, were much lower in the barA mutant, suggesting that BarA is required for the expression of this RpoS-regulated gene. Expression of another RpoS-regulated gene, osmY, was also found to be severely reduced in the barA mutant. Employing Western analyses with anti-RpoS antisera and Northern analyses using probes specific for rpoS, we found that BarA is required for the exponential phase induction of RpoS itself. Operon lacZ fusion expression studies and Northern analyses indicate that BarA itself is maximally expressed in early exponential phase cultures immediately preceding the transcriptional induction of RpoS. Results of primer extension studies indicate that exponential phase expression from the rpoSp1 promoter is reduced by more than 85% in a barA mutant but could be efficiently complemented by a plasmid-borne copy of barA in trans. These results suggest that regulatory signals that are operant in exponentially growing cultures play an important role in effecting stationary phase gene expression.},

Resistance was restored to wild-type levels by complementation with plasmids expressing ppk, the gene for PPK [the polyphosphate kinase that generates poly(P)]. Induction of expression of both katE and rpoS (the stationary-phase sigma factor) was prevented in cells in which the poly(P)ase was overproduced.

In this paper, we report that expression of sdiA is itself regulated by a factor that is released into the growth medium by E. coli. When medium that had previously supported growth of E. coli (conditioned medium) was used to support growth of an indicator E. coli strain that contained an sdiA-lacZ transcriptional reporter, there was a 50 to 80% decrease in sdiA expression as monitored by beta-galactosidase activity. The down-regulation of PsdiA was associated with a decrease in expression of the SdiA target promoter ftsQ2p, as monitored by expression of an ftsQ2p-lacZ transcriptional fusion. An effect of conditioned medium on ftsQ2p expression was not seen when the wild-type sdiA gene was disrupted by insertional mutagenesis, indicating that the effect on ftsQ2p expression was secondary to the down-regulation of PsdiA. Conditioned medium had no effect on expression of Plac, PrpoS, or several other promoters associated with the ftsQAZ gene cluster (ftsQ1p and ftsZ1-4p). This suggests that the response is specific for PsdiA and for promoters that are regulated by the sdiA gene product and that cell-to-cell signalling may play a role in regulating expression of this group of genes.},

Furthermore, the slowdown in growth as cells entered the stationary phase in rich medium, a result of carbon source depletion, was associated with an increase in katE and katF expression. A simple reduction in the carbon source level as the cells entered the stationary phase was not responsible for the increase in expression, because transferring the culture to a medium with no glucose did not induce expression from either promoter. Spent rich medium from stationary-phase cells was capable of inducing expression, as were simple aromatic acids such as benzoate, o-hydroxybenzoate, and p-aminobenzoate added to new medium. Anaerobiosis did not cause an increase in expression, nor did it significantly change the pattern of expression. Regardless of the medium, katF expression was always turned on before or coincidently with katE expression; in the presence of benzoate katF was fully induced, whereas katE was only partially induced, suggesting that a factor in addition to KatF protein was involved in katE expression.

While katE was found to be regulated primarily at the level of transcription (since induction patterns were similar for both transcriptional and translational fusions), katF expression was a function of both transcriptional and translational signals. The katE gene was induced 57-fold as cells entered the stationary phase, while katF was induced 23-fold. katF induction was coincident with katE induction and occurred at the onset of the stationary growth phase. Expression of both katE and katF could be induced by resuspending uninduced exponential-phase cells in spent culture supernatant recovered from stationary-phase cells. The component of stationary-phase culture supernatant responsible for induction of the katF regulon appeared to be acetate, since expression of both katE and katF fusions was induced when exponential-phase cells were exposed to this weak acid. Other weak acids, including propionate and benzoate, were also found to be effective inducers of expression of both katF and katE. Induction of katE and katF fusions was unaffected in merodiploid strains containing both mutant and wild-type alleles, indicating that expression of both genes is independent of the wild-type gene product.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

In the wild-type strain, rpoS transcription was greater under aerobic than under microaerobic conditions, whereas transcription of arcA was suppressed by aerobiosis. Under aerobic conditions, no interaction between NuoG, CydA, ArcA and RpoS was detected. Under microaerobic conditions, rpoS was suppressed in the nuoG mutant as compared with the wild-type strain, but it was overexpressed in the cydA and arcA mutants. A deletion in the rpoS gene, on the other hand, resulted in non-restricted, increased arcA expression in stationary-phase cultures under microaerobic conditions. Based on the rpoS transcription in the nuoG mutant the authors propose that the decrease in the NADH:NAD ratio that occurs when carbon sources become limiting serves as a signal for increased rpoS transcription, while active respiration catalysed by CydA and controlled by ArcA downregulates rpoS transcription. When, finally, the RpoS-controlled stationary phase of growth is reached, arcA is suppressed in an RpoS-dependent fashion. Transition into stationary phase under microaerobic conditions is thus controlled by coordinated action of the RpoS and ArcA regulators, depending on subtle changes in the environment.},

   Abstract = {H-NS is a small chromatin-associated protein found in enterobacteria. H-NS has affinity for all types of nucleic acids but binds preferentially to intrinsically curved DNA. The major role of H-NS is to modulate the expression of a large number of genes, mostly by negatively affecting transcription. Many of the H-NS-modulated genes are regulated by environmental signals, and expression of most of these genes is positively regulated by specific transcription factors. Therefore one of the purposes of H-NS could be to repress expression of some genes under conditions characteristic of a non-intestinal environment, but allow expression of specific genes in response to certain stimuli in the intestinal environment. The hns gene is autoregulated. In vivo the H-NS to DNA ratio is fairly constant except during cold shock, when it increases three- to fourfold. In this review we propose that only the preferential binding to intrinsically curved DNA plays a role under normal growth conditions, and we discuss the different mechanisms by which H-NS might affect gene expression and how H-NS could be involved in the response to different stress situations. Finally, we summarize the evolutionary and functional relationship between H-NS and the homologous StpA.},

This rpoS-encoded alternative sigmaS factor induces a number of genes implicated in cell survival in stationary phase and in multiple stress resistance. By analysis of rpoS-lacZ fusions and by pulse-chase experiments, we show that the efficiency of rpoS translation is reduced in cells lacking HU, whereas neither rpoS transcription nor protein stability is affected by HU. Gel mobility shift assays show that HU is able to bind specifically an RNA fragment containing the translational initiation region of rpoS mRNA 1000-fold more strongly than double-stranded DNA. Together with the in vivo data, this finding strongly suggests that, by binding to rpoS mRNA, HU directly stimulates rpoS translation. We demonstrate here that HU, an abundant DNA-binding, histone-like protein, is able specifically to recognize an RNA molecule and therefore play a role in post-transcriptional regulation.},

The product of the hfq gene, host factor I (HF-I), is a ribosome-associated, site-specific RNA-binding protein originally characterized for its role in replication of the RNA bacteriophage Qbeta of Escherichia coli. In this study, the role of HF-I was explored by isolating suppressor mutations that map to the region directly upstream of rpoS. These mutations increase rpoS-lac expression in the absence of HF-I and also confer substantial independence from HF-I. DNA sequence analysis of the mutants suggests a model in which the RNA secondary structure near the ribosome binding site of the rpoS mRNA plays an important role in limiting expression in the wild type. Genetic tests of the model confirm its predictions, at least in part. It seems likely that the mutations analyzed here activate a suppression pathway that bypasses the normal HF-I-dependent route of rpoS expression; however, it is also possible that some of them identify a sequence element with an inhibitory function that is directly counteracted by HF-I.},

Transcription of the hupA gene is activated early in logarithmic phase. A little later, at mid to late exponential phase, RNA originating at the hupB-P2 promoter is detected. The hupB-P3 promoter is activated last when the cells enter stationary phase. Although the hup mRNAs are unstable, the HU protein is very stable so that the variations in the mRNAs synthesis are reflected in the level of the two HU subunits and in the composition of HU dimers. Cells growing exponentially contain a mixture of homodimeric alpha 2 and heterodimeric alpha beta but no beta 2 is detected. In stationary cells, the predominant form is the heterodimer alpha beta. The presence of the heterodimeric form is required for optimal survival of E. coli after prolonged starvation. The three forms of HU are not equivalent, since beta 2 is incapable of promoting formation of DNA supercoiling like alpha beta and alpha 2 do. The putative roles of each form of HU are discussed.},

One of these was identified as the outer membrane porin protein, OmpF. In the stpA hns double mutant, the level of OmpF was downregulated dramatically, whereas in hns or stpA single mutants, it was affected only slightly. Transcription from the ompF promoter was reduced by 64% in the double mutant; however, the level of ompF mRNA was reduced by 96%. This post-transcriptional expression was found to result from a strong reduction in the half-life of ompF message in the double mutant. The micF antisense RNA was shown to be involved in OmpF regulation by StpA using a strain deleted for micF. Moreover, micF antisense RNA accumulated considerably in an stpA hns background. Transcriptional data from a micF-lacZ fusion and measurements of micF RNA half-life confirmed that this was caused by transcriptional derepression of micF as a result of the hns lesion and increased micF RNA stability due to the absence of StpA (a known RNA chaperone). These data suggest a novel facet to the regulation of OmpF expression, namely destabilization of micF RNA by StpA.},

Moreover, recent data suggest that HU may also participate in homologous recombination. In particular, it has been shown that P1 transduction is inhibited in the absence of HU [Kano and Imamoto, Gene 89 (1990) 133-137]. In contrast, we found that transductional recombination and conjugational recombination were almost normal in hupA hupB mutants. However, it appeared that the recombination proficiency of hupA hupB mutant bacteria was reduced tenfold in an intrachromosomal recombination assay. Moreover, we found that intrachromosomal recombination was reduced tenfold in a gyrB226 strain and by more than 100-fold in an osmZ205 strain. The gyrB226 mutation affects the DNA gyrase activity, while mutations in osmZ are highly pleiotropic, affecting the expression of a variety of genes and increasing the frequency of site-specific inversion events. Since it has been shown that the hupA hupB mutations, like the gyrB226 mutation, decrease the level of DNA supercoiling, whereas the osmZ205 mutation increases the level of DNA supercoiling, it appears that the histone-like proteins HU and OsmZ may play a key role in intrachromosomal recombination by affecting the DNA topology.},

   Abstract = {Translational regulation of the stationary phase sigma factor RpoS is mediated by the formation of a double-stranded RNA stem-loop structure in the upstream region of the rpoS messenger RNA, occluding the translation initiation site. The interaction of the rpoS mRNA with a small RNA, DsrA, disrupts the double-strand pairing and allows high levels of translation initiation. We screened a multicopy library of Escherichia coli DNA fragments for novel activators of RpoS translation when DsrA is absent. Clones carrying rprA (RpoS regulator RNA) increased the translation of RpoS. The rprA gene encodes a 106 nucleotide regulatory RNA. As with DsrA, RprA is predicted to form three stem-loops and is highly conserved in Salmonella and Klebsiella species. Thus, at least two small RNAs, DsrA and RprA, participate in the positive regulation of RpoS translation. Unlike DsrA, RprA does not have an extensive region of complementarity to the RpoS leader, leaving its mechanism of action unclear. RprA is non-essential. Mutations in the gene interfere with the induction of RpoS after osmotic shock when DsrA is absent, demonstrating a physiological role for RprA. The existence of two very different small RNA regulators of RpoS translation suggests that such additional regulatory RNAs are likely to exist, both for regulation of RpoS and for regulation of other important cellular components.},

Mainly because of increased rpoS translation and stabilization of sigma(S), which in nonstressed cells is a highly unstable protein, the cellular sigma(S) content increases during entry into stationary phase and in response to hyperosmolarity. Here, we identify the hfq-encoded RNA-binding protein HF-I, which has been known previously only as a host factor for the replication of phage Qbeta RNA, as an essential factor for rpoS translation. An hfq null mutant exhibits strongly reduced sigma(S) levels under all conditions tested and is deficient for growth phase-related and osmotic induction of sigma(S). Using a combination of gene fusion analysis and pulse-chase experiments, we demonstrate that the hfq mutant is specifically impaired in rpoS translation. We also present evidence that the H-NS protein, which has been shown to affect rpoS translation, acts in the same regulatory pathway as HF-I at a position upstream of HF-I or in conjunction with HF-I. In addition, we show that expression and heat induction of the heat shock sigma factor sigma(32) (encoded by rpoH) is not dependent on HF-I, although rpoH and rpoS are both subject to translational regulation probably mediated by changes in mRNA secondary structure.

Here we show that an hfq mutant strain is defective for DsrA-mediated regulation of both rpoS and hns. The defect in rpoS expression can be partially overcome by overexpression of DsrA. Hfq does not regulate the transcription of DsrA, and DsrA does not alter the accumulation of Hfq. However, in an hfq mutant, chromosome-expressed DsrA was unstable (half-life of 1 min) and truncated at the 3' end. When expressed from a multicopy plasmid, DsrA was stable in both wild-type and hfq mutant strains, but it had only partial activity in the hfq mutant strain. Purified Hfq binds DsrA in vitro.

The roles of these genes in bacteria remain largely unknown. We report here the characterization of two chromosomal hfq insertion mutations. An omega (omega) cassette insertion near the end of hfq resulted in phenotypes only slightly different from the parent, although transcript mapping demonstrated that the insertion was completely polar on hflX expression. In contrast, an equally polar omega cassette insertion near the beginning of hfq caused pronounced pleiotropic phenotypes, including decreased growth rates and yields, decreased negative supercoiling of plasmids in stationary phase, increased cell size, osmosensitivity, increased oxidation of carbon sources, increased sensitivity to ultraviolet light, and suppression of bgl activation by hns mutations. hfq::omega mutant phenotypes were distinct from those caused by omega insertions early in the miaA tRNA modification gene. On the other hand, both hfq insertions interfered with lambda phage plaque formation, probably by means of polarity at the hflA region. Together, these results show that hfq function plays a fundamental role in Escherichia coli physiology and that hfq and the hflA-region are in the amiB-mutL-miaA-hfq-hflX superoperon.},

   Abstract = {The MutS, MutL, and MutH proteins play major roles in several DNA repair pathways. We previously reported that the cellular amounts of MutS and MutH decreased by as much as 10-fold in stationary-phase cultures. Consequently, we tested whether the amounts of MutS, MutL, and MutH were regulated by two global regulators, RpoS (sigma38) and Hfq (HF-I [putative RNA chaperone]), which are involved in stationary-phase transition. We report here that mutations in hfq and rpoS reversed the stationary-phase down-regulation of the amounts of MutS and MutH. hfq regulation of the amount of MutS in stationary-phase cultures was mediated by RpoS-dependent and -independent mechanisms, whereas hfq regulation of the amount of MutH was mediated only through RpoS. Consistent with this interpretation, the amount of MutS but not MutH was regulated by Hfq, but not RpoS, in exponentially growing cells. The amount of MutL remained unchanged in rpoS, hfq-1, and rpoS+, hfq+ strains in exponentially growing and stationary-phase cultures and served as a control. The beta-galactosidase activities of single-copy mutS-lacZ operon and gene fusions suggested that hfq regulates mutS posttranscriptionally in exponentially growing cultures. RNase T2 protection assays revealed increased amounts of mutS transcript that are attributed to increased mutS transcript stability in hfq-1 mutants. Lack of Hfq also increased the amounts and stabilities of transcripts initiated from P(miaA) and P1hfqHS, two of the promoters for hfq, suggesting autoregulation, but did not change the half-life of bulk mRNA. These results suggest that the amounts of MutS and MutH may be adjusted in cells subjected to different stress conditions by an RpoS-dependent mechanism. In addition, Hfq directly or indirectly regulates several genes, including mutS, hfq, and miaA, by an RpoS-independent mechanism that destabilizes transcripts.},

The 5' untranslated region is the stability determinant of this transcript and the target of the endoribonuclease, RNase E, the key player of mRNA degradation. An RNA-binding protein with affinity for the 5' untranslated region ompA was purified and identified as Hfq, a host factor initially recognized for its function in phage Qbeta replication. The ompA RNA-binding activity parallels the amount of Hfq, which is elevated in bacteria cultured at slow growth rate, a condition leading to facilitated degradation of the ompA mRNA. In hfq mutant cells with a deficient Hfq gene product, the RNA-binding activity is missing, and analysis of the ompA mRNA showed that the growth-rate dependence of degradation is lost. Furthermore, the half-life of the ompA mRNA is prolonged in the mutant cells, irrespective of growth rate. Hfq has no affinity for the lpp transcript whose degradation, like that of bulk mRNA, is not affected by bacterial growth rate. Compatible with our results, we found that the intracellular concentration of RNase E and its associated degradosome components is independent of bacterial growth rate. Thus our results suggest a regulatory role for Hfq that specifically facilitates the ompA mRNA degradation in a growth rate-dependent manner.},

The Escherichia coli ompA mRNA has served as one of the paradigms for regulated mRNA decay in prokaryotes. The stability of the transcript is known to be correlated inversely with the bacterial growth rate. Thus, the regulation of ompA mRNA stability meets the physiological needs to adjust the level of ompA expression to the rate of cell division. Recently, host factor I (Hfq/HF1) was shown to be involved in the regulation of ompA mRNA stability under slow growth conditions. Here, we present the first direct demonstration that 30S ribosomes bound to the ompA 5'-UTR protect the transcript from RNase E cleavage in vitro. However, the 30S protection was found to be abrogated in the presence of Hfq. Toeprinting and in vitro translation assays revealed that translation of ompA is repressed in the presence of Hfq. These in vitro studies are corroborated by in vivo expression studies demonstrating that the reduced synthesis rate of OmpA effected by Hfq results in functional inactivation of the ompA mRNA. The data are discussed in terms of a model wherein Hfq regulates the stability of ompA mRNA by competing with 30S ribosomes for binding to the ompA 5'-UTR.},

   Abstract = {In Escherichia coli, recent intensive studies revealed that expression of a certain subset of genes is under the control of the stationary phase-specific sigma factor, sigma S, which is encoded by the rpoS gene. Since sigma S functions predominantly under certain growth conditions, its activity and/or cellular content has accordingly to be tightly controlled, however, the underlying molecular mechanism is at present unclear. We previously demonstrated that expression of the cbpA gene, encoding an analogue of the DnaJ molecular chaperone, is largely dependent on sigma S function. Here we have found that a mutational lesion of the hns gene, which encodes one of the well-characterized nucleoid proteins, H-NS, affects the cellular content of sigma S remarkably and consequently affects the expression of cbpA. Enhanced accumulation of sigma S in hns deletion cells was particularly observed in the logarithmic growth phase and was demonstrated to result from an elevated translational efficiency of rpoS mRNA and also from an increased stability of newly synthesized sigma S. Although H-NS is known to influence the transcription of a number of apparently unlinked genes on the chromosome, in this study we provide a novel instance in which H-NS is deeply implicated in post-transcriptional regulation(s) of the expression of rpoS. As to physiological relevance, it was also demonstrated that hns deletion cells exhibit an extreme thermotolerance even in the logarithmic growth phase, presumably because of the enhanced accumulation of sigma S.},

   Pages = {667-72.},
   Abstract = {DsrA is an 87 nucleotide Escherichia coli RNA with extraordinary regulatory properties. The profound impact of its actions stems from DsrA regulating translation of two global transcription regulators, H-NS and RpoS (sigmas), by sequence-specific RNA-RNA interactions. H-NS is a major nucleoid-structuring and global repressor protein, and RpoS is the stationary phase and stress response sigma factor of RNA polymerase. DsrA changes its conformation to bind to these two different mRNA targets and thereby inhibits H-NS translation, while stimulating that of RpoS in a mechanistically distinct fashion. DsrA apparently binds both the start and the stop codons of hns mRNA and sharply decreases the mRNA half-life. DsrA also binds sequences in the 5'-untranslated leader region of rpoS mRNA, enhancing rpoS mRNA stability and RpoS translation. A cohort of genes, governed by H-NS repression and RpoS activation, are thus regulated. Low temperatures increase the levels of DsrA, with differential effects on H-NS and RpoS. Additionally, the RNA chaperone protein Hfq is involved with DsrA regulation, as well as with other small RNAs that also act on RpoS to co-ordinate stress responses. We address the possible functions of this genetic regulatory mechanism, as well as the advantages of using small RNAs as global regulators to orchestrate gene expression.},

DsrA activates RpoS translation by pairing with the leader of the mRNA. We find that temperature affects both the rate of transcription initiation of the dsrA gene and the stability of DsrA RNA. Both are increased at low temperature (25 degrees C) compared to 37 or 42 degrees C. The combination of these results is 25-fold-less DsrA at 37 degrees C and 30-fold less at 42 degrees C than at 25 degrees C. Using an adapted lacZ-based reporter system, we show that temperature control of transcription initiation of dsrA requires only the minimal promoter of 36 bp. Overall, transcription responses to temperature lead to a sixfold increase in DsrA synthesis at 25 degrees C over that at 42 degrees C. Furthermore, two activating regions and a site for LeuO negative regulation were identified in the dsrA promoter. The activating regions also activate transcription in vitro. DsrA decays with a half-life of 23 min at 25 degrees C and 4 min at 37 and 42 degrees C. These results demonstrate that the dsrA promoter and the stability of DsrA RNA are the thermometers for RpoS temperature sensing.

Here, we report the characterization of a transposon insertion mutant (Tn10-8) with reduced sigmaS levels that led to the identification of an additional factor involved in the regulation of rpoS translation, the LysR-like regulator LeuO. Tn10-8 decreases rpoS translation predominantly at low growth temperature. The mutation results in similarly strongly reduced DsrA-RNA expression and does not affect rpoS expression in a dsrA null mutant background, indicating that it affects rpoS translation via DsrA-RNA. Tn10-8 is inserted 26bp upstream of the leuO open reading frame, which encodes a putative LysR-like regulator of unknown function. Instead of being a leuO null mutation, Tn10-8 activates leuO expression as a result of the p(out) promoter on IS10L reading into leuO, indicating that LeuO represses dsrA and thereby reduces rpoS translation at low temperature. LeuO does not contribute to temperature regulation of dsrA since its own expression is rather low and not temperature dependent. In a mutant deficient for H-NS, however, leuO is strongly derepressed. We conclude that rpoS translation is controlled by a regulatory network that includes Hfq, H-NS, LeuO and DsrA-RNA. In this network, H-NS plays a dual role by interfering with rpoS translation in general and, via LeuO, influencing the synthesis of its own low-temperature antagonist, DsrA-RNA.},

Studies reported here indicate that DnaK is also required for starvation-induced osmotolerance, catalase activity, and the production of the RpoS-controlled Dps (PexB) protein. Because these dnaK mutant phenotypes closely resemble those of rpoS (sigma38) mutants, the relationship between DnaK and RpoS was evaluated directly during growth and starvation at 30 degrees C in strains with genetically altered DnaK content. A starvation-specific effect of DnaK on RpoS abundance was observed. During carbon starvation, DnaK deficiency reduced RpoS levels threefold, while DnaK excess increased RpoS levels nearly twofold. Complementation of the dnaK mutation restored starvation-induced RpoS levels to normal. RpoS deficiency had no effect on the cellular concentration of DnaK, revealing an epistatic relationship between DnaK and RpoS. Protein half-life studies conducted at the onset of starvation indicate that DnaK deficiency significantly destabilized RpoS. RpoH (sigma32) suppressors of the dnaK mutant with restored levels of RpoS and dnaK rpoS double mutants were used to show that DnaK plays both an independent and an RpoS-dependent role in starvation-induced thermotolerance. The results suggest that DnaK coordinates sigma factor levels in glucose-starved E. coli.},

The repertoire of sigmaS -dependent genes that are subsequently expressed confers tolerance to a variety of potentially lethal conditions including low pH and stationary phase. The mechanism(s) responsible for triggering sigmaS accumulation are of considerable interest, because they help to ensure survival of the organism during encounters with suboptimal environments. Two genes associated with regulating sigmaS levels in S. typhimurium have been identified. The first is clpP, encoding the protease known to be responsible for degrading sigmaS in Escherichia coli. The second is dksA, encoding a protein of unknown function not previously associated with regulating sigmaS levels. As predicted, clpP mutants accumulated large amounts of sigmaS even in log phase. However, dksA mutants failed to accumulate sigmaS in stationary phase and exhibited lower accumulation during acid shock in log phase. DksA appears to be required for the optimal translation of rpoS based upon dksA mutant effects on rpoS transcriptional and translational lacZ fusions. The region of rpoS mRNA between codons 8 and 73 is required to see the effects of dksA mutations. This distinguishes the role of DksA from that of HF-I (hfq ) in rpoS translation, as the HF-I target area occurs well upstream of the rpoS start codon. DksA appears to be involved in the expression of several genes in addition to rpoS based on two-dimensional SDS-PAGE analysis of whole-cell proteins. As a result of their effects on gene expression, mutations in clpP and dksA decreased the virulence of S. typhimurium in mice, consistent with a role for sigmaS in pathogenesis.},

In an attempt to identify additional regulatory components in this network, we have isolated Tn10 insertion mutations that in trans alter the expression of osmY and other sigma S-dependent genes. One of these mutations conferred glucose sensitivity and was localized in pgi (encoding phosphoglucose isomerase). pgi::Tn10 strains exhibit increased basal levels of expression of osmY and otsBA in exponentially growing cells and reduced osmotic inducibility of these genes. A similar phenotype was also observed for pgm and galU mutants, which are deficient in phosphoglucomutase and UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, respectively. This indicates that the observed effects on gene expression are related to the lack of UDP-glucose (or a derivative thereof), which is common to all three mutants. Mutants deficient in UDP-galactose epimerase (galE mutants) and trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (otsA mutants) do not exhibit such an effect on gene expression, and an mdoA mutant that is deficient in the first step of the synthesis of membrane-derived oligosaccharides, shows only a partial increase in the expression of osmY. We therefore propose that the cellular content of UDP-glucose serves as an internal signal that controls expression of osmY and other sigma S-dependent genes. In addition, we demonstrate that pgi, pgm, and galU mutants contain increased levels of sigma S during steady-state growth, indicating that UDP-glucose interferes with the expression of sigma S itself.},

Two members of this family, CspC and CspE, are constitutively produced at 37 degrees C. In the present study, these two proteins were evaluated for their cellular role(s). The expression of three stress proteins, OsmY, Dps, and UspA, is significantly affected by the overexpression and deletion of CspC and CspE. RpoS is a regulatory element for osmY and dps. Further analysis showed a larger amount and greater stability of the rpoS mRNA as well as a higher level of RpoS itself with the overexpression of CspC and CspE. This suggests that CspC and CspE upregulate the expression of OsmY and Dps by regulating the expression of RpoS itself. Indeed, this upregulation is lost in the Delta rpoS strain. Other RpoS-controlled proteins such as ProP and KatG, are also upregulated by the overexpression of CspC. The present study suggests that CspC and CspE are the important elements involved in the regulation of the expression of RpoS, a global stress response regulator, and UspA, a protein responding to numerous stresses. In the light of these observations, it seems plausible that CspC and CspE function as regulatory elements for the expression of stress proteins in the complex stress response network of E. coli.},

Western immunoblot analysis showed that in mutants lacking the protease ClpP or its cognate ATPase-containing subunit ClpX, sigma s levels of exponential-phase cells increased to those of stationary-phase wild-type cells. Lack of other potential partners of ClpP, i.e., ClpA or ClpB, or of Lon protease had no effect. In ClpXP-proficient cells, the stability of sigma s increased markedly in stationary-phase compared with exponential-phase cells, but in ClpP-deficient cells, sigma s became virtually completely stable in both phases. There was no decrease in ClpXP levels in stationary-phase wild-type cells. Thus, sigma s probably becomes more resistant to this protease in stationary phase. The reported sigma s-stabilizing effect of the hns mutation also was not due to decreased protease levels. Studies with translational fusions containing different lengths of sigma s coding region suggest that amino acid residues 173 to 188 of this sigma factor may directly or indirectly serve as at least part of the target for ClpXP protease.},

We demonstrate here that a response regulator, RssB, plays a crucial role in the control of the cellular sigma(S) content. rssB null mutants exhibit nearly constitutively high levels of sigma(S) and are impaired in the post-transcriptional growth phase-related and osmotic regulation of sigma(S). Whereas rpoS translational control is not affected, sigma(S) is stable in rssB mutants, indicating that RssB is essential for sigma(S) turnover. RssB contains a unique C-terminal output domain and is the first known response regulator involved in the control of protein turnover.},

   Abstract = {Sigma(S) (RpoS) is a highly unstable global regulatory protein in Escherichia coli, whose degradation is inhibited by various stress signals, such as carbon starvation, high osmolarity and heat shock. As a consequence, these stresses result in the induction of sigma(S)-regulated stress-protective proteins. The two-component-type response regulator, RssB, is essential for the rapid proteolysis of sigma(S) and is probably involved in the transduction of some of these stress signals. Acetyl phosphate can be used as a phosphodonor for the phosphorylation of various response regulators in vitro and, in the absence of the cognate sensor kinases, acetyl phosphate can also modulate the activities of several response regulators in vivo. Here, we demonstrate increased in vivo half-lives of sigma(S) and the RpoS742::LacZ hybrid protein (also a substrate for RssB-dependent proteolysis) in acetyl phosphate-free (pta-ackA) deletion mutants, even though no sensor kinase was eliminated. The in vivo data indicate that acetyl phosphate acts through the response regulator, RssB. In vitro, efficient phosphotransfer from radiolabelled acetyl phosphate to the Asp-58 residue of RssB (the expected site of phosphorylation in the RssB receiver domain) was observed. Via such phosphorylation, acetyl phosphate may thus modulate RssB activity even in an otherwise wild-type background. While acetyl phosphate is not essential for the transduction of specific environmental stress signals, it could play the role of a modulator of RssB-dependent proteolysis that responds to the metabolic status of the cells reflected in the highly variable cellular acetyl phosphate concentration.},

   Abstract = {In growing Escherichia coli cells, the master regulator of the general stress response, sigmaS (RpoS), is subject to rapid proteolysis. In response to stresses such as sudden carbon starvation, osmotic upshift or shift to acidic pH, sigmaS degradation is inhibited, sigmaS accumulates and numerous sigmaS-dependent genes with stress-protective functions are activated. sigmaS proteolysis is dependent on ClpXP protease and the response regulator RssB, whose phosphorylated form binds directly to sigmaS in vitro. Here, we show that substitutions of aspartate 58 (D58) in RssB, which result in higher sigmaS levels in vivo, produce RssB variants unable to bind sigmaS in vitro. Thus, RssB is the direct substrate recognition factor in sigmaS proteolysis, whose affinity for sigmaS depends on phosphorylation of its D58 residue. RssB does not dimerize or oligomerize upon this phosphorylation and sigmaS binding, and RssB and sigmaS exhibit a 1:1 stoichiometry in the complex. The receiver as well as the output domain of RssB are required for sigmaS binding (as shown in vivo and in vitro) and for complementation of an rssB null mutation. Thus, the N-terminal receiver domain plays an active and positive role in RssB function. Finally, we demonstrate that RssB is not co-degraded with sigmaS, i.e. RssB has a catalytic role in the initiation of sigmaS turnover. A model is presented that integrates the details of RssB-sigmaS interaction, the RssB catalytic cycle and potential stress signal input in the control of sigmaS proteolysis.},

Homologues to CspA, the major cold-shock protein in E. coli, have been described in various psychrotrophs, but unlike their mesophilic counterparts, they belong to the group of Caps. Although they have been poorly studied, Caps are of particular importance since they differentiate psychrotrophs from mesophiles, and they are probably one of the key determinant that allow life at very low temperature.},

This optimization of the catalytic parameters can originate from a highly flexible structure which provides enhanced abilities to undergo conformational changes during catalysis. Thermal instability of cold-adapted enzymes is therefore regarded as a consequence of their conformational flexibility. A survey of the psychrophilic enzymes studied so far reveals only minor alterations of the primary structure when compared to mesophilic or thermophilic homologues.

In order to reduce the error impact inherent to the transition state theory on the absolute values of the free energy (DeltaG(#)), enthalpy (DeltaH(#)) and entropy (DeltaS(#)) of activation, it is proposed to compare the variation of these parameters between psychrophilic and mesophilic enzymes, namely Delta(DeltaG(#))(p-m), Delta(DeltaH(#))(p-m) and Delta(DeltaS(#))(p-m). Calculation of these parameters from the available literature shows that the main adaptation of psychrophilic enzymes lies in a significant decrease of DeltaH(#), therefore leading to a higher k(cat), especially at low temperatures. Moreover, in all cases including cold-blooded animals, DeltaS(#) exerts an opposite and negative effect on the gain in k(cat). It is argued that the magnitude of this counter-effect of DeltaS(#) can be reduced by keeping some stable domains, while increasing the flexibility of the structures required to improve catalysis at low temperature, as demonstrated in several cold-active enzymes. This enthalpic-entropic balance provides a new approach explaining the two types of conformational stability detected by recent microcalorimetric experiments on psychrophilic enzymes.},

   Abstract = {Psychrophilic and psychrotrophic microorganisms are important in global ecology as a large proportion of our planet is cold (below 5 degrees C); they are responsible for the spoilage of chilled food and they also have potential uses in low-temperature biotechnological processes. Psychrophiles and psychrotrophs are both capable of growing at or close to zero, but the optimum and upper temperature limits for growth are lower for psychrophiles compared with psychrotrophs. Psychrophiles are more often isolated from permanently cold habitats, whereas psychrotrophs tend to dominate those environments that undergo thermal fluctuations. The molecular basis of psychrophily is reviewed in terms of biochemical mechanisms. The lower growth temperature limit is fixed by the freezing properties of dilute aqueous solutions inside and outside the cell. In contrast, the ability of psychrophiles and psychrotrophs to grow at low, but not moderate, temperatures depends on adaptive changes in cellular proteins and lipids. Changes in proteins are genotypic, and are related to the properties of enzymes and translation systems, whereas changes in lipids are genotypic or phenotypic and are important in regulating membrane fluidity and permeability. The ability to adapt their solute uptake systems through membrane lipid modulation may distinguish psychrophiles from psychrotrophs. The upper growth temperature limit can result from the inactivation of a single enzyme type or system, including protein synthesis or energy generation.},

   Abstract = {Bacteria which live in cold conditions are known as psychrophiles. Since so much of our planet is generally cold, i.e. below 5 degrees C, it is not surprising that they are very common amongst a wide variety of habitats. To enable them to survive and grow in cold environments, psychrophilic bacteria have evolved a complex range of adaptations to all of their cellular components, including their membranes, energy-generating systems, protein synthesis machinery, biodegradative enzymes and the components responsible for nutrient uptake. Whilst such a systems approach to the topic has its advantages, all of the changes can be described in terms of adaptive alterations in the proteins and lipids of the bacterial cell. The present review adopts the latter approach and, following a brief consideration of the definition of psychrophiles and description of their habitats, focuses on those adaptive changes in proteins and lipids, especially those which are either currently being explored for their biotechnological potential or might be so in the future. Such applications for proteins range from the use of cold-active enzymes in the detergent and food industries, in specific biotransformations and environmental bioremediations, to specialised uses in contact lens cleaning fluids and reducing the lactose content of milk; ice-nucleating proteins have potential uses in the manufacture of ice cream or artificial snow; for lipids, the uses include dietary supplements in the form of polyunsaturated fatty acids from some Antarctic marine psychrophiles.},

The quadruple-deletion strain acquired cold sensitivity and formed filamentous cells at 15 degrees C although chromosomes were normally segregated. The cold-sensitivity and filamentation phenotypes were suppressed by all members of the CspA family except for CspD, which causes lethality upon overexpression. Interestingly, the cold sensitivity of the mutant was also suppressed by the S1 domain of polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), which also folds into a beta-barrel structure similar to that of CspA. The present results show that cold-shock proteins and S1 domains share not only the tertiary structural similarity but also common functional properties, suggesting that these seemingly distinct protein categories may have evolved from a common primordial RNA-binding protein.},

   Abstract = {The CspA family of Escherichia coli comprises nine homologous proteins, CspA to CspI. CspA, the major cold shock protein, binds RNA with low sequence specificity and low binding affinity. This is considered to be important for its proposed function as an RNA chaperone to prevent the formation of secondary structures in RNA molecules, thus facilitating translation at low temperature. The cellular functions of other Csp proteins are yet to be fully elucidated, and their sequence specific binding capabilities have not been identified. As a step towards identification of the target genes of Csp proteins, we investigated the RNA binding specificities of CspB, CspC and CspE by an in vitro selection approach (SELEX). In the present study, we show that these proteins are able to bind preferentially to specific RNA/single-stranded DNA sequences. The consensus sequences for CspB, CspC and CspE are U/T stretches, AGGGAGGGA and AU/AT-rich regions, especially AAAUUU, respectively. CspE and CspB have Kd values in the range 0.23-0.9 x 10(-6) M, while CspC has 10-fold lower binding affinity. Consistent with our recent findings of transcriptional regulation of cspA by CspE, we have identified a motif identical to the CspE consensus. This motif is the putative CspE-mediated transcription pause recognition site in a 5'-untranslated region of the cspA mRNA.},

Csp proteins interact with single-stranded nucleic acids and destabilize nucleic acid secondary structures. Some Csp proteins also act as transcription antiterminators in vivo and in vitro. Here, we selected a mutation in the cloned cspE gene that abolished CspE-induced transcription antitermination. In vitro, mutant CspE showed RNA binding activity similar to that of the wild-type CspE but was unable to destabilize nucleic acid secondary structures. Thus, nucleic acid melting ability of CspE and its transcription antitermination activity are correlated. In vivo, mutant cspE was functional with respect to up-regulation of expression of rpoS, but, unlike the wild-type cspE, it did not complement the cold-sensitive phenotype of the quadruple DeltacspADeltacspBDeltacspGDeltacspE deletion strain. Thus, the nucleic acid-melting activity of Csp is critical for its prototypical function of supporting low temperature survival of the cell.},

Anti-sigma factors bind to sigma factors and inhibit their transcriptional activity. Studies on the mechanism of action of anti-sigma factors has shed new light on the regulation of gene expression in bacteria, as the anti-sigma factors add another layer to transcriptional control via negative regulation. Their cellular roles are as diverse as FIgM of Salmonella typhimurium, which can be exported to sense the structural state of the flagellar organelle, to SpoIIAB of Bacillus subtilis participating in the switch from one cell type to another during the process of sporulation. Additionally, the bacteriophage T4 uses an anti-sigma factor to sabotage the Escherichia coli E.sigma 70 RNA polymerase in order to direct exclusive transcription of its own genes. Cross-linking, co-immunoprecipitations, and co-purification indicate that the anti-sigma factors directly interact with their corresponding sigma factor to negatively regulate transcription. In B. subtilis, anti anti-sigma factors regulate anti-sigma factors by preventing an anti-sigma factor from interacting with its cognate sigma factors, thereby allowing transcription to occur.},

   Abstract = {When starved, Bacillus subtilis undergoes asymmetric division to produce two cell types with different fates. The larger mother cell engulfs the smaller forespore, then nurtures it and, eventually, lyses to release a dormant, environmentally resistant spore. Driving these changes is a programme of transcriptional gene regulation. At the heart of the programme are sigma factors, which become active at different times, some only in one cell type or the other, and each directing RNA polymerase to transcribe a different set of genes. The activity of each sigma factor in the cascade is carefully regulated by multiple mechanisms. In some cases, novel proteins control both sigma factor activity and morphogenesis, co-ordinating the programme of gene expression with morphological change. These bifunctional proteins, as well as other proteins involved in sigma factor activation, and even precursors of sigma factors themselves, are targeted to critical locations, allowing the mother cell and forespore to communicate with each other and to co-ordinate their programmes of gene expression. This signalling can result in proteolytic sigma factor activation. Other mechanisms, such as an anti-sigma factor and, perhaps, proteolytic degradation, prevent sigma factors from becoming active in the wrong cell type. Accessory transcription factors modulate RNA polymerase activity at specific promoters. Negative feedback loops limit sigma factor production and facilitate the transition from one sigma factor to the next. Together, the mechanisms controlling sigma factor activity ensure that genes are expressed at the proper time and level in each cell type.},

   Abstract = {In the flagellar regulon of Salmonella typhimurium, the flagellar operons are divided into three classes, 1, 2, and 3, with respect to transcriptional hierarchy. The class 2 operons are controlled positively by the class 1 genes, flhD and flhC. The class 3 operons are controlled positively by fliA and negatively by flgM. It has been shown that FliA is a sigma factor specific for class 3, whereas FlgM is an anti-sigma factor which binds FliA to prevent its association with RNA polymerase core enzyme. Therefore, the FliA-FlgM regulatory system has been believed to control specifically the class 3 operons. In the present study, we showed that the flgM mutation enhanced the expression of class 2 by more than fivefold. When a fliA mutation was present simultaneously, this enhancement was not observed. These results indicate that the FliA-FlgM regulatory system is involved not only in the expression of class 3 but also in that of class 2. However, though neither flhD nor flhC mutants could express the class 2 operons, the fliA mutants permitted the basal-level expression of those operons. Therefore, FlhD and FlhC are indispensable for the expression of class 2, whereas FliA is required only for its enhancement in the FlgM-depletion condition. Furthermore, we showed that the flgM mutation resulted in a two- to threefold increase in flagellar number. On the basis of these results, we propose that the relative concentration of FliA and FlgM may play an important role in the determination of flagellar numbers produced by a single cell.},

   Abstract = {Switching of the transcription pattern in Escherichia coli during the growth transition from exponential to stationary phase is accompanied by the replacement of the RNA polymerase-associated sigma70 subunit (sigmaD) with sigma38 (sigmaS). A fraction of the sigma70 subunit in stationary phase cell extracts was found to exist as a complex with a novel protein, designated Rsd (Regulator of sigma D). The intracellular level of Rsd starts to increase during the transition from growing to stationary phase. The rsd gene was identified at 90 min on the E. coli chromosome. Overexpressed and purified Rsd protein formed complexes in vitro with sigma70 but not with other sigma subunits, sigmaN, sigmaS, sigmaH, sigmaF, and sigmaE. Analysis of proteolytic fragments of sigma70 indicated that Rsd binds at or downstream of region 4, the promoter -35 recognition domain. The isolated Rsd inhibited transcription in vitro to various extents depending on the promoters used. We propose that Rsd is a stationary phase E. coli protein with regulatory activity of the sigma70 function.},

   Journal = {Mol Microbiol},
   Volume = {24},

   Pages = {373-85.},
   Abstract = {The extracytoplasmic stress response in Escherichia coli is controlled by the alternative sigma factor, sigma(E). sigma(E) activity is uniquely induced by the accumulation of outer membrane protein precursors in the periplasmic space, and leads to the increased production of several proteins, including the periplasmic protease DegP, that are thought to be required for maintaining cellular integrity under stress conditions. Genetic and biochemical experiments show that sigma(E) activity is under the control of three genes, rseABC (for regulator of sigma E), encoded immediately downstream of the sigma factor. Deletion of rseA leads to a 25-fold induction of sigma(E) activity. RseA is predicted to be an inner membrane protein, and the purified cytoplasmic domain binds to and inhibits sigma(E)-directed transcription in vitro, indicating that RseA acts as an anti-sigma factor. Deletion of rseB leads to a slight induction of sigma(E), indicating that RseB is also a negative regulator of sigma(E). RseB is a periplasmic protein and was found to co-purify with the periplasmic domain of RseA, indicating that RseB probably exerts negative activity on sigma(E) through RseA. Deletion of rseC, in contrast, has no effect on sigma(E) activity under steady-state conditions. Under induction conditions, strains lacking RseB and/or C show wild-type induction of sigma(E) activity, indicating either the presence of multiple pathways regulating sigma(E) activity, or the ability of RseA alone to both sense and transmit information to sigma(E).},

   Abstract = {The E. coli 6S RNA was discovered more than three decades ago, yet its function has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that 6S RNA associates with RNA polymerase in a highly specific and efficient manner. UV crosslinking experiments revealed that 6S RNA directly contacts the sigma70 and beta/beta' subunits of RNA polymerase. 6S RNA accumulates as cells reach the stationary phase of growth and mediates growth phase-specific changes in RNA polymerase. Stable association between sigma70 and core RNA polymerase in extracts is only observed in the presence of 6S RNA. We show 6S RNA represses expression from a sigma70-dependent promoter during stationary phase. Our results suggest that the interaction of 6S RNA with RNA polymerase modulates sigma70-holoenzyme activity.},

Recent experiments with mammalian RNA polymerase II along with accumulating evidence from studies of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase indicate the importance of DNA bending and wrapping in transcriptional mechanisms. The DNA-wrapping model describes specific roles for general RNA polymerase II transcription factors (TATA-binding protein [TBP], TFIIB, TFIIF, TFIIE, and TFIIH), provides a plausible explanation for preinitiation complex isomerization, suggests mechanisms underlying the synergy between transcriptional activators, and suggests an unforseen role for TBP-associating factors in transcription.},

   Title = "{Using CLUSTAL for multiple sequence alignments}",
   Journal = {Methods Enzymol},
   Volume = {266},
   Pages = {383-402.},
   Abstract = {We have tested CLUSTAL W in a wide variety of situations, and it is capable of handling some very difficult protein alignment problems. If the data set consists of enough closely related sequences so that the first alignments are accurate, then CLUSTAL W will usually find an alignment that is very close to ideal. Problems can still occur if the data set includes sequences of greatly different lengths or if some sequences include long regions that are impossible to align with the rest of the data set. Trying to balance the need for long insertions and deletions in some alignments with the need to avoid them in others is still a problem. The default values for our parameters were tested empirically using test cases of sets of globular proteins where some information as to the correct alignment was available. The parameter values may not be very appropriate with nonglobular proteins. We have argued that using one weight matrix and two gap penalties is too simplistic to be of general use in the most difficult cases. We have replaced these parameters with a large number of new parameters designed primarily to help encourage gaps in loop regions. Although these new parameters are largely heuristic in nature, they perform surprisingly well and are simple to implement. The underlying speed of the progressive alignment approach is not adversely affected. The disadvantage is that the parameter space is now huge; the number of possible combinations of parameters is more than can easily be examined by hand. We justify this by asking the user to treat CLUSTAL W as a data exploration tool rather than as a definitive analysis method. It is not sensible to automatically derive multiple alignments and to trust particular algorithms as being capable of always getting the correct answer. One must examine the alignments closely, especially in conjunction with the underlying phylogenetic tree (or estimate of it) and try varying some of the parameters. Outliers (sequences that have no close relatives) should be aligned carefully, as should fragments of sequences. The program will automatically delay the alignment of any sequences that are less than 40% identical to any others until all other sequences are aligned, but this can be set from a menu by the user. It may be useful to build up an alignment of closely related sequences first and to then add in the more distant relatives one at a time or in batches, using the profile alignments and weighting scheme described earlier and perhaps using a variety of parameter settings. We give one example using SH2 domains. SH2 domains are widespread in eukaryotic signalling proteins where they function in the recognition of phosphotyrosine-containing peptides. In the chapter by Bork and Gibson ([11], this volume), Blast and pattern/profile searches were used to extract the set of known SH2 domains and to search for new members. (Profiles used in database searches are conceptually very similar to the profiles used in CLUSTAL W: see the chapters [11] and [13] for profile search methods.) The profile searches detected SH2 domains in the JAK family of protein tyrosine kinases, which were thought not to contain SH2 domains. Although the JAK family SH2 domains are rather divergent, they have the necessary core structural residues as well as the critical positively charged residue that binds phosphotyrosine, leaving no doubt that they are bona fide SH2 domains. The five new JAK family SH2 domains were added sequentially to the existing alignment of 65 SH2 domains using the CLUSTAL W profile alignment option. Figure 6 shows part of the resulting alignment. Despite their divergent sequences, the new SH2 domains have been aligned nearly perfectly with the old set. No insertions were placed in the original SH2 domains. In this example, the profile alignment procedure has produced better results than a one-step full alignment of all 70 SH2 domains, and in considerably less time. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)},
